Food systems are changing, and changing at an enormous speed. Along with the change in dietary patterns and lifestyles, our community disease profile is also changing. Instead of the infectious diseases like cholera and TB, now the non-communicable ailments (NCDs) such cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, hypertension, cancers, mental disorders and obesity are the main reasons behind unhealthy life, disabilities and death. Why is food or dietary pattern important in disease burden? The answer is simple: human beings are also chemical beings. What they eat interacts with of their body and mind in various complex ways. With this simple sensibility comes a great understanding that oil and fats, added sugars (e.g. sugary drinks) and salt are dietary risk factors in the increasing incidence and prevalence of NCDs. 
In Pakistan, NCDs now cause more than 60% of deaths, and around 30% are attributed to CVDs and these deaths are higher than global average. Pakistan hosts the third largest population of people with diabetes in the world i.e. 33 million whereas 10 million more are pre-diabetic. Hypertension is also taking its toll with 43% of adults ageing 30-79 are carrying the disease, and, most importantly, not everyone is being treated with high-quality standard treatment regime for these diseases.
All this tells us a sad story of lives being lost prematurely i.e. before the age of 70; family financial losses due to inability to work and spending hard-earned money on treatments of avoidable diseases; and deaths at the time when one is thought to be the most productive, thereby stunting our GDP. This story calls for action — not only for some sort of awareness, but also for policy and administrative measures to build and strengthen a health security regime in the country. 
While there is no one silver bullet to solve the problems of CVDs, high blood pressure, high blood glucose and high body mass index, there are certain policy measures and best policy practices which can be applied to control dietary risk factors for a majority of population. First and foremost, we propose and advocate for looking seriously into the prevalent state of affairs in food systems and its governance. One of the most important aspects is to ensure that food supply is safe to consume and is nutritious. 
Looking at the supply of fats and vanaspati ghee, Pakistan encounters serious problems to deal with. In Pakistan, most of the street food and vanaspati ghee is replete with iTFAs (industrially produced trans fatty acids) which many medical researches have declared associated with NCDs. WHO recommends that there should be no more than 2% of iTFAs in any fat used in any food item. Pakistan is many moons away from implementing this best practice policy which has helped reduce CVDs in many countries such as Denmark. Countries like Saudi Arabia have even banned the production of vanaspati ghee to completely eradicate the menace from food supplies. Our foods, specially the highly processed, fast and frozen foods, have high quantities of added sugars and sodium, and our society is falling prey to these risky food supplies. Over and above, such foods are sold without proper front of product labelling (FOPL) and warning signs. 
So, in addition to the need of having good quality accessible and affordable healthcare to everyone, there is a need to provide safe to consume food so that our health system does not break down due to the ever-increasing pressure of unwell and unhealthy population. 
Last but not least, we propose and argue for modernising the system of food related governance. We need to build technical, human, infrastructure and legal-administrative capacity of various institutions such as Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority, PCSIR and Provincial Food Authorities, and look at the “new foods” part of public health concerns. It is hoped that by controlling dietary risk factors, Pakistan ensures a better health security regime for its citizens.

Leading industrialists in Sindh have labelled 2023 as lacklustre and troublesome, plagued by energy crises, economic meltdown, strikes, and a lack of government support. Despite these challenges, they maintain an optimistic approach in 2024 and hope for the best.
“2023 was tumultuous, with industrialists facing numerous challenges, including skyrocketing gas and electricity tariffs, almost doubling, causing a severe economic slowdown, impacting cash flow, and rendering the industry uncompetitive compared to regional countries. It was an uphill battle,” remarked Muhammad Kamran Arbi, President of the Site Association of Industry (SAI).
He highlighted that after multiple assurances from caretaker setups, industrialists are hopeful for a better 2024. Arbi also called for a clear and consistent industrial policy, endorsing the Charter of Economy presented by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) to promote industry and exports.
As Karachi enters 2024, the city’s industrial landscape continues to grapple with challenges from the preceding year, noted Siraj S Monnoo, President of the Landhi Association of Trade and Industry. He added that 2023 painted a sombre picture of economic hardships, prompting a call for strategic interventions.
Throughout 2023, Karachi’s industries faced a complex set of challenges, ranging from soaring utility tariffs to issues of gas availability, water shortages, corruption, political instability, inflation, and inadequate infrastructure, he said. This amalgamation of difficulties posed a significant threat to the sustainability of businesses in the region.
Acknowledging the indispensable role of supporting industries in Karachi’s economic fabric, Monnoo stressed the need for a comprehensive strategy to address multifaceted challenges. He highlighted that this strategy should encompass effective governance, impactful policy reforms, and targeted investments to foster holistic economic improvement.
Looking ahead to 2024, he said as Karachi enters this year, business leaders are poised to apply lessons learned from the challenges of the past year. The emphasis on effective governance, policy reforms, and strategic investments remains paramount.
Read Industrialists demand 2-year economic policy
“The challenges of 2023 serve as a catalyst for holistic development strategies in 2024. Business leaders like me are expected to actively participate in shaping policies, engaging in collaborative initiatives, and driving investments that contribute to the comprehensive economic improvement of Karachi,” he said.
Despite the significant challenges of the past year, Karachi’s industrial sector remains steadfast in its pursuit of a brighter economic future, he said, adding that collaborative efforts set the stage for a resilient and dynamic business environment in 2024, underscoring the collective responsibility to overcome obstacles and build a prosperous future for the city.
President of the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI), Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani stated that 2023 was a tumultuous year for the country, largely attributed to the significant surge in electricity and gas tariffs following stringent directives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He pointed out that in comparison with India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam, Pakistan faces nearly double the electricity and gas costs, presenting a challenging barrier for the country’s industries to enhance production and bolster exports.
Shaikhani stressed that solely relying on foreign investments, while sidelining domestic investment, would not foster economic stability, as foreign investors tend to follow local investors. Countries that do not provide adequate facilities to local investors seldom attract foreign investment. Nurturing and supporting domestic investors is pivotal to attract foreign investment and stabilise the economy. 
To address these challenges, he advocated prioritising the continuity of economic policies to spur fresh investments. Emphasising the significance of thorough examination and consultation with stakeholders, a comprehensive, long-term investment policy must be crafted.

Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) extended its losing streak on Wednesday as it witnessed a mixed trading session that succumbed to profit-taking, ending the day slightly below the 64,000 mark with a loss of 250 points.
In the morning, trading started on a negative note but after taking a dip, the market quickly gained ground, led by buying interest in Pakistan Petroleum and Oil and Gas Development Company.
The momentum continued well after midday, resultantly, the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day high at 64,550.94 points.
However, investor sentiment received a blow in the absence of major positive triggers coupled with the prevailing political uncertainty. The market succumbed to late-session profit-booking in banking and fertiliser sectors and ended the session below the 64,000 mark.
“Stocks closed bearish due to late-session selling amid pre-poll uncertainty and foreign fund outflows,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Mid-session support came on the back of upbeat data of home remittances that surged 13% year-on-year (YoY), or $282 million, and increase in global crude oil prices,” he said.
“Political uncertainty and worries about the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) policy rate announcement this month amid surging inflation played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 250.73 points, or 0.39%, and settled at 63,919.85.
Topline Securities, in its report, noted that it was “another day of consolidation”.
Pakistan equities moved in both directions. Initially, the KSE-100 index hit the intra-day high at 64,551 (+380 points, or 0.59%), it said, adding that profit-taking forced the index to lose the earlier ground. Owing to investor selling, the PSX could not hold the 64,000 level.
Investors took profit in selective stocks of banking and fertiliser sectors in the backdrop of increasing noise on the political front and the absence of positive triggers. It marked the fifth consecutive negative session at the PSX.
Read Despite fall, PSX stays above 64,000 mark
Resultantly, Meezan Bank, Engro Corporation, Bank AL Habib, Engro Fertilisers and United Bank cumulatively lost 182 points, Topline said.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, stated that “breaking down from 64,000 sets up a test of key near-term support at 63,000 before resuming higher towards 67,000”.
“Seasonal factors favour a rising market into February, which should coincide with a new high,” it said, adding that with two sessions to go this week, price action remained inside last week’s range.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said that it was the third consecutive day of losses at the PSX this week.
“Investors are advised to adopt a cautious stance and accumulate value stocks on dips,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 636.2 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 448.99 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs17.98 billion.

A Pakistani textile firm’s collaboration with a Danish material science company has resulted in the production of eco-friendly yarn and fabric from maize waste. The prototype was initially unveiled at the Heimtextil exhibition, a global textile fair. Towel products catering to newborns, infants, and individuals with skin sensitivities will be crafted from these sustainable materials. Following a successful trial, commercial production of yarn from corn and sugarcane waste is slated to commence in Pakistan.
At Heimtextil 2024, the world’s largest home textile industry exhibition, the fabric created from bio-engineered yarn by Pakistani textile firm Feroze 1888 Mills Limited, in partnership with Danish material science company Pond, stole the spotlight. Bioengineering textile fabric is a burgeoning trend globally, with a focus on creating sustainable products for the environment, businesses, and consumers. The demand for fabric made from natural ingredients, particularly organic and agricultural products, coupled with recycling, is rapidly increasing.
To maintain its standing in the global market, the Pakistani textile industry must diversify into new materials beyond traditional options like cotton and polyester. The production of yarn and fabric from corn and sugarcane waste by a Pakistani firm indicates a proactive approach by major players in Pakistan’s industry, showcasing an awareness and embrace of global market trends that surpass competitors.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Martin Jensen, Chief Technical Officer and Co-Founder of Pond, elucidated the collaboration at the Heimtextil exhibition. He said Pond’s focus on producing bio-engineered yarn from natural ingredients and agricultural waste like grasses, coffee plants, sugarcane husks, and corn husks. Jensen highlighted the global recognition received by big brands utilizing Pond’s fabric in clothing and joggers.

Jensen noted the keen interest shown by Feroze 1888 Mills Limited in Pond’s technology, leading to the production of a special fabric in Karachi under a joint project. This fabric, derived from corn husks, stands out for its softness, suppleness, and skin-friendly qualities, coupled with a significantly low electrical charge compared to polyester fabric.
Attributing the preference for Pakistani firms over those in India and Bangladesh to Pakistan’s prominent position in the home textile industry, he expressed satisfaction with the positive reception of the new fabric at Heimtextil. He anticipates further collaboration phases, including the production of bio-engineered yarn in Pakistan and partnerships with additional Pakistani firms.
Deputy General Manager of Planning, Development, and Innovation at Feroze 1888 Mills Ltd., Aamir Shabbir Ansari underscored the company’s commitment to environmentally friendly practices. The collaboration with Pond aligns with the company’s sustainability goals. Ansari shared that the fabric from corn waste, produced in collaboration with Pond at the Karachi facility, marks a significant contribution to Pakistan’s positive global image.
As a pilot project, the fabric has been developed from corn waste, blended with 50% cotton. Following the successful trial, commercial production is planned under favourable business conditions, with a flexible blend of 10% to 50% bioengineered yarn based on product and customer demand.

The inflows of workers’ remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis increased by 13% to $2.38 billion in December 2023, as they dispatched the funds through official channels following the return of stability in the rupee-dollar parity and the crackdown against illegal currency networks.
The improvement in remittances fuelled the ongoing gradual rally in the rupee against the US dollar on Wednesday, strengthening the market view that the balance of the current account would record a surplus for the second consecutive month of December 2023.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that remittances rose by 13% compared to $2.10 billion in the same month of December of the previous year.
Inflows improved by 5.5% in the month compared to $2.26 billion in the prior month of November 2023.
However, workers’ remittances have cumulatively slowed down by 7% in the first half (Jul-Dec) of the current fiscal year 2023-24, amounting to $13.45 billion compared to $14.42 billion in the same period of the previous year, according to the central bank.
Topline Securities, CEO, Muhammad Sohail mentioned that the latest monthly inflows of $2.38 billion are higher than the full-year 2023 average of $2.20 billion a month.
Market talk suggests that the receipts have increased due to the crackdown against foreign currency smugglers, such as hawala-hundi operators and hoarders, since September 2023.
The cleanup operation crushed illicit currency markets, especially in the bordering areas with Afghanistan, and strengthened the hold of official operating networks like commercial banks and authorised exchange companies.
The crackdown not only helped arrest the then freefall in the domestic currency but also assisted it in bouncing back by over 9%, or around Rs26 in the past four months, closing at a 10-week high at Rs281.13 against the US dollar on Wednesday. Earlier, it had hit an all-time low at Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
The inflows of workers’ remittances play a pivotal role in the economy, significantly helping finance the twin trade and current account deficits.
The total inflows in the first half of FY24 have, however, slipped by 7% due to high volatility in the currency between July-September 2023, in the wake of the then political and economic instability, according to market talks.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Maaz Azam, Research Analyst at Optimus Capital Management, projected that the inflows would remain better in the second half of the ongoing fiscal year amid stability in the rupee-dollar exchange rate.
He estimated the average inflows at $2.4 billion a month during January-June 2024, including likely spikes above the average in the months around Ramadan and Eid festivals falling in the second half of FY24.
Read Remittances increase to $2.38 billion in December 2023
He foresaw FY24 full-year workers’ remittances inflows at $28.6 billion, slightly higher compared to the receipts at $27.3 billion recorded in FY23.
He noted that risk factors, which if occur, would disrupt the improved inflows, including the return of political and economic instability after the new political government is formed post the February 2024 general elections and a delay in the acquisition of another IMF programme after the current one of $3 billion completes in March 2024.
“The political instability and delays in the IMF new programme, if they take place, may allow illicit players to re-establish illegal currency markets and mount pressure on the rupee.”
On the flip side, a better-than-estimated increase in economic activities would prompt non-resident Pakistanis to send higher remittances, including for investment purposes. “The inflows would surge along with economic activities.”
He believed that overseas Pakistanis slowed down the dispatch of remittances for investment purposes amid the economic slowdown in the first half of FY24.
Region-wise inflows:
The central bank reported that remittance inflows during December 2023 were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia at $578 million, increasing by 9% from $530 million received in the same month of the previous year.
Non-resident Pakistanis dispatched $419 million from the United Arab Emirates in the month, which was 27% higher compared to $331 million in the same month of the previous year.
Expatriates sent 15% higher remittances at $368 million from the United Kingdom compared to $321 million.
They dispatched 9% higher remittances at $264 million from the United States of America compared to $243 million.
Inflows from other GCC countries improved 6% to $255 million in the month compared to $240 million.
Pakistanis from European Union countries sent $285 million remittances, which were 19% higher compared to $240 million.
Workers’ remittances surged by 9% to $213 million from other countries around the world in December 2023 compared to $195 million in December 2022.

In line with market expectations, the increase in inflows of workers’ remittances supported the rupee, hitting over a 10-week high at above Rs281 against the US dollar in the interbank market, maintaining a winning streak for the sixth successive working day on Wednesday.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency appreciated by 0.03%, or Rs0.09, to close at Rs281.13 against the greenback. It has cumulatively increased by 1.60% or Rs4.51 in the past six weeks to date, as the supply of foreign currency surpassed the demand in the market.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the currency improved by 0.56%, or Rs0.16, to close at Rs282.18/$ in the open market on a day-to-day basis. The central bank reported on Wednesday morning that the inflows of workers’ remittances have boosted by 13% to $2.38 billion in December 2023 compared to the same month last year. This supported the rupee to maintain the uptrend.
Read Rupee rises to two and a half month high at Rs281.26/$
Moreover, the optimism that the IMF executive board will approve the release of the next tranche of $700 million on Thursday (today) also supported the rupee.
The expected inflows, along with the receipts of $1.3 billion from multilateral creditors over the past two weeks, maintained the supply of foreign currency higher than its demand.
The development also prompted exporters to advance selling US dollars on the futures counter, as dealers believe the currency would soon hit Rs280/$ on the upside. Market talks suggest that the downturn in the international petroleum crude oil price was another significant reason for the gradual rally in the currency. Pakistan heavily relies on imported energies to meet local demand.

An international cybersecurity and digital privacy company has reported that 15% of companies globally have experienced cyber incidents due to insufficient cybersecurity investment.
It is alarming that critical infrastructure, oil and gas and energy organisations have suffered the biggest number of cyber incidents.
According to a recent study conducted by Kaspersky, 15% of companies across the world encountered cyber incidents owing to the dearth of investment in that critical area over the last two years.
When it came to companies’ finances, one in five admitted they did not have the budget for adequate cybersecurity measures.
Kaspersky undertook the study to discover opinions of IT security professionals working for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other companies worldwide regarding the human impact on cybersecurity in a company. The telecommunications sector suffered 13% of cyber incidents due to budget constraints, while transport and logistics, and financial services’ companies each saw 8% of incidents.
When asked about the budget for cybersecurity measures, 78% of respondents said they were equipped to keep up with or even stay ahead of new threats.
However, 21% of companies were not doing so well while 18% reported that they didn’t have sufficient funds to protect the company’s infrastructure properly.
Read IT minister unveils cybersecurity measures
At the same time, there were companies having no cost allocations at all for cybersecurity. As many as 3% claimed they didn’t have a dedicated budget for cyber protection needs.
According to the report, many companies were eager to take steps to strengthen their cybersecurity system over the next up to one and a half year.
One of the most popular areas of investment is threat detection software and training where 39% of companies plan to allocate budget for educational programmes for cybersecurity professionals and 38% for training general staff.
Other popular measures organisations plan to take soon are introducing endpoint protection software, hiring additional IT professionals, and adopting SaaS cloud solutions. “Today, companies must align cybersecurity investment with business strategy and consider cybersecurity as one of their business goals,” commented Ivan Vassunov, VP Corporate Products at Kaspersky, adding that challenges could be met through the use of various modern approaches and technologies.

The resurgence of extortion in the city has heightened concerns among businessmen and industrialists. December witnessed 11 reported cases, a notable decrease from the 60 cases recorded throughout the just ended year. 
Despite Karachi police’s claims to bolster law and order, street crime persists, leaving the business community uneasy. A network, allegedly from Iran and Afghanistan, is implicated in the deaths of three businessmen within a month due to non-payment of extortion demand. Apparently, Sindh police’s efforts to dismantle this network appear insufficient.
The recent incidents include the broad daylight killing of Shahzad Jafarani, a steel trader, in South district at city’s busiest market. A gang war operative involved in the murder was reportedly killed in a police encounter. In the New Karachi Industrial Area, Osama Moon, a businessman’s son, was attacked by suspects who had demanded extortion money.

The Citizen Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) reported 11 extortion cases in December, acknowledging that many cases go unreported due to businessmen’s fear of dire consequences from criminals.
Despite the establishment of a Specialized Investigation Unit (SIU) by the CIA to probe extortion cases, challenges persist in identifying suspects distributing extortion slips. As a result, industrialists are advised to remain vigilant regarding routes, timings, and vehicle changes during their journeys.

Last year was not any different from preceding years in terms of street crime in the commercial hub of Pakistan. But the last month of 2023 was in particular challenging as muggers struck at will, revealing the vulnerability of citizens to street criminals. Alarmingly, 52 lives were lost in violent robberies and other violence during the same period.
Data compiled by the Citizen Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) showed a huge increase in street crimes as 206 vehicles, 4,777 motorcycles, and 2,095 mobile phones, were stolen and snatched within a month. These concerning figures excluded cases of murder, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion.

The streets of Karachi will soon witness trained women behind the wheels of the distinctive pink buses. The final phase of training for female drivers is underway at Mehran Depot and is set to conclude on January 15.
Despite Pakistan facing challenges in terms of gender equality, courageous women in Karachi are actively working to narrow this gap by venturing into non-traditional fields. The women-only pink buses, which previously employed women conductors, will now also feature women drivers.
According to details, the Sindh Mass Transit Authority, a division of the Sindh government, has initiated training for 18 women on diesel hybrid, electric hybrid, and fully electric buses. Training encompasses a range of skills and equipment, such as driving, engine, battery, communication, and safety protocols.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Kiran Iftikhar, confidently taking the driving seat of a hybrid bus, said that with strong ambitions, nothing is insurmountable. She emphasised that women have the capability to drive buses and will prove it through their actions. Kiran urged other women to step out of their homes, learn, and contribute to the workforce.

Abdul Shakur, Operational Manager of People's Bus Service, shared that in the initial phase, women with driving licenses will be permitted to operate on the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. The Sindh Mass Transit Authority envisions including transgender individuals in this profession, extending opportunities for inclusivity.
Trainer Advocate Zakia Sultana educated female drivers on relevant laws and accident prevention strategies. Zakia highlighted that confident women from various parts of Sindh, including post-graduate students, have embraced the role of bus drivers. Zakia also encouraged transgenders stepping forward, emphasising equality among all citizens.
Advocate Ahsan Ali highlighted that women drivers have been made aware of driving-related laws to ensure their protection. He outlined specific sections, including Section 279, Section 320, Section 8, and General Defence, to equip women with legal knowledge in case of stops or fines.
The second phase of training at Mehran Depot follows the initial phase conducted by the Motorway police.
The presence of female drivers and conductors in pink buses stands as a tangible example of empowered and resilient women, challenging stereotypes and contributing to a more inclusive society.

The Sindh High Court rejected the petitions against the acceptance of nomination papers of PTI's Khurram Sher Zaman, Awab Alvi and Muzamil Aslam from constituency NA-241 and upheld their candidature.
A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Sindh High Court Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi heard the petitions against the Election Tribunal's decision about PTI candidates.
The lawyer supporting the rejection plea said that Khurram Sher Zaman had not mentioned his wife's assets in the documents. The court inquired whether these assets belong to Khurram Sher Zaman or his wife. 
The lawyer argued that it is the matter of concealment of assets. According to the election law, a candidate is also obliged to disclose the assets of his wife. Khurram Sher Zaman's wife Bushra Sher Zaman's sales tax account has been suspended. Account suspension is also due to the fraud.
The Chief Justice while giving remarks said that such objections are not made on this occasion. The court told the lawyer, you can file an application even after the election. "At this point we have to see that there is no misrepresentation in the basic details of the proposer, endorser or candidate. You are considering suspension of sales tax account as a criminal penalty."
Haider Waheed Advocate stated that the business of Khurram Sher Zaman's wife was closed in 2012. The lawyer objected to the position that Khurram Sher Zaman has not been notified yet. Lawyers cannot represent him. If more time is needed to collect the material, it can be provided.
About Muzamil Aslam the lawyer said that he did not disclose the vehicles among his assets.

Muzamil's lawyer stated that whenever he brings the vehicle on the road, he will get it registered and pay the tax. There is no question of loss to the public exchequer.
The lawyer, on the objection against the approval of the papers of Awab Alvi, the third candidate from NA-241, the son of President Alvi, took the stand that Awab Alvi was allowed to participate in the election illegally.
The Chief Justice remarked that this application is also from the same constituency. The lawyer stated that petitions have been filed against all PTI candidates.
The lawyer submitted that the objection is raised by Muhammad Dost, a Pakistan dost citizen. He does not want corrupt elements to become parliamentarians.
The Chief Justice smilingly directed the lawyer of the objector to introduce us to that Pakistan dost man sometime. The court rejected the application of objections against the three PTI candidates and allowed them to participate in the election.
Meanwhile, the same bench of the Sindh High Court accepted the petition of PTI leader Alamgir Khan, a candidate from NA-236, against the decision of the Appellate Tribunal.
The court accepted the petition of Alamgir Khan and annulled the decision of the Election Tribunal and allowed the PTI leader Alamgir Khan to participate in the election from constituency NA-236. Alamgir Khan's nomination papers were rejected by the returning officer.
Besides, the Sindh High Court accepted the petition of PTI candidate Syed Amjad Hussain Shah against the decision of the Election Tribunal in constituency PS-75 Thatta. 
The petitioner's counsel took the stand that Amjad Shah has sold the vehicle, the dues are less than 10,000 and he has been acquitted.
The court allowed the candidate to contest the election. Syed Amjad Shah's papers were rejected by the RO and then by the Appellate Tribunal.

JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday met with Afghanistan’s supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada in Kabul wherein it was assured that the next elections in Pakistan would be held peacefully and efforts would be made for the resumption of Islamabad’s talks with the banned outfit Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The Afghan government also demanded that Islamabad would have to play its role in the elimination of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) as well as chalk out a visa-free policy on the Chaman border alongside a soft plan on the expulsion of its refugees.
Kandahar Governor Mullah Shirin Akhund had promised a meeting of Haibatullah with the JUI-F chief on his visit to Kabul, but declined a huddle with other delegates.
Fazl and Haibatullah discussed the TTP, ISKP, border management, soft visa policy, and refugees during their one-on-one meeting.
The JUI-F chief promised that he would take up the issues of Kabul with the relevant quarters in Islamabad, but pressed the sureties of a ceasefire till peaceful elections in Pakistan, a source said.
The meeting was scheduled by former Kandahar governor Haji Yousuf Wafa. He is currently the governor of the Balkh province.
The source confirmed that Fazl took flight to Kandahar later in the day accompanied by Mullah Idrees and met with some members of the former Quetta Shura.
The overall visit of Fazl will bring a positive impact on the tense relationship between the two neighbouring countries. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been simmering for months over Kabul’s failure to stop the TTP-sponsored attacks from across the border.
Soon a short-term ceasefire with the TTP will be announced or there will be an unannounced one between the two sides.
Sources from the delegation also confirmed that a meeting of Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group is also on the agenda.
It has also been learnt that a day might also be added to the unannounced period of the JUI-F chief’s visit to Afghanistan.
Many Afghan Taliban members including those who are in the government have studied from seminaries run by the JUI-F. Observers believe that Pakistan may use the influence of the JUI-F chief to sort out the issue of the TTP.
An 11-member delegation, headed by the JUI-F chief, and including former South Waziristan MNA Maulana Jamaluddin Mehsud, Mufti Ibrar and members from the Haqqani religious seminary, are in Afghanistan since January 7.
Despite repeated attempts, the JUI-F spokesperson, who otherwise had been giving regular updates about Fazl’s engagements in Afghanistan, could not be reached.
The Afghan Taliban chief rarely meets leaders from outside. This was the only second known meeting he held with any foreign leader following his interaction with the Qatari Prime Minister last year.
The meeting could be a turning point in the bilateral ties between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban government. The two governments are at loggerheads over the issue of banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Sources familiar with the development said Maulana Fazl was given a brief and talking points about Pakistan’s stance before he traveled to Afghanistan. The sources said Maulana Fazl was told to convey a clear message to the Taliban chief that Kabul had to choose between Pakistan and the TTP.
The JUI-F chief was also told to inform the Taliban chief that without resolution of the TTP problem bilateral relationship could not move forward.
The Afghan Taliban government has so far not given any indication to take on the TTP. In fact, Maulana Fazl was told during a meeting with the Afghan Interim Prime Minister that the TTP was an internal problem of Pakistan and that it should find a solution from within.
One source, who deals with the Afghan issue, said if this was an attitude of the Taliban government then there won’t be any breakthrough. The source said the Taliban government was well aware that the TTP and its leadership were in Afghanistan. They had the “sanctuaries” and this was also corroborated by the UN and other countries, according to sources.
The JUI-F chief wanted to travel to Kabul to congratulate the Afghan Taliban for their return to power in August 2021 but he could not due to various reasons.
The sources, nevertheless, claimed that the Afghan Taliban, earlier, were not keen to extend him the invitation. Since Pakistan virtually severed high-level contacts with the Kabul regime, the Afghan Taliban decided to invite Maulana Fazl to share its perspective on the TTP and other issues.
Officials are skeptical about any major breakthrough because of the close links between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The visit may lower the temperature between the two sides but the prospects of any major headway are slim, according to sources.
Pakistani policymakers would now be waiting for the JUI-F chief’s briefing on his return to know what exactly transpired in his meeting with the Taliban supreme leader.
Some observers see the meeting as a last ditch effort to sort out the issue of TTP.With additional input from Kamran Yousaf in Islamabad
In a dramatic prelude to the February 8 elections, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday hurdled past objections to his candidacy from NA-130 while incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan faced the sting of rejection on appeals against the dismissal of his nomination papers for two National Assembly seats.
The appellate election tribunals delivered what came as a “double-edged verdict”, granting a clean chit to the Sharif family, including Nawaz Sharif, while quashing appeals by the former premier Imran Khan, former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, along with his wife and son, Moonis Elahi, against the rejection of their nomination papers.
Two separate appellate tribunals upheld the ROs' decision to reject Imran nomination papers.
The PTI’s founding chairman faced the stumbling block – potentially ousted from the electoral battleground – just as the party celebrated the return of its cherished ‘Bat’ symbol.
Meanwhile, the election tribunals also gave the green light to PTI’s Dr Yasmeen Rashid from NA-130, Mian Mehmood ur Rasheed from PP-169 and various other contestants from distinct constituencies by overturning the Returning Officers' decisions that previously rejected their nomination papers.
The election tribunals, in dismissing appeals, affirmed the decision of the ROs to accept the nomination papers of Nawaz Sharif from NA-130, Shehbaz Sharif from NA-132, and Maryam Nawaz from NA-119.
The appellants had contested the ROs' acceptance of their nomination papers.
The tribunals upheld the decisions of the ROs, dismissing appeals lodged by PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan from NA-122, as well as the appeals of PTI's former chief minister Ch. Pervez Elahi, his wife Qaisara Elahi, and their son Moonis Elahi from NA-64, NA-69, PP-32, and PP-34.
The twelve-judge election tribunals of the Lahore High Court (LHC) presided over appeals filed by contestants challenging the acceptance or rejection of their nomination papers by the respective ROs. January 10 marked the final day for appeal hearings.
To address challenges against the election tribunals' decisions, the LHC had initially formed a larger bench comprising five members, including Justice Shujaat Ali Khan, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Faisal Zaman, and Justice Jawad Hassan.
However, Justice Faisal Zaman withdrew from the bench, and Justice Shujaat Ali Khan was on medical leave during this period.
Following this, LHC CJ Muhammad Ameer Bhatti established a larger three-member bench comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Shahd Bilal, and Justice Jawad Hassan.
 
Sharif family
An appellate tribunal on Monday had reserved its verdict on an appeal against the acceptance of Nawaz Sharif’s nomination papers from NA-130, Lahore.
Read Tribunal gives clean chit to Sharif family to contest polls
Pakistan Awami Mahaz chief Ishtiaq Ahmad Chaudhry, a lawyer, filed the appeal under section 63 of the Election Act 2017.
The appellant argued that Nawaz could not contest an election due to lifetime disqualification held by the Supreme Court for a person disqualified under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
He said the former prime minister was disqualified by the apex court for not being ‘sadiq’ and ‘ameen’ under article 62(1)(f).
In the case of former prime minister and PML-N president, the appellant had challenged RO’s decision of accepting his nomination papers, alleging “he had been identified as the mastermind of alleged criminal attack on the supreme court on November 28, 1997”.
Similarly, the appellant had challenged RO’s decision to accept the nomination papers of PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz on the grounds that she is not ‘sadiq’ and ‘ameen’.
The petitioner objector contended that ROs’ decision to accept her nomination papers from NA-119 was illegal and unlawful.
He cited various TV talk shows where Maryam Nawaz, during a live news segment with anchorperson Sana Bucha, publicly stated that she "doesn't have any property in London or even in Pakistan."
However, in a separate statement to anchorperson Sohail Warraich, she declared that she "owned assets worth about 100 crores." In addition, in an interview with anchorperson Javed Ch, Maryam
Nawaz's brother asserted that she is the beneficiary of his property in London.
He stressed that Maryam Nawaz has faced convictions in different cases, including the Panama case. Despite her declaration in the nomination papers stating no ownership of property outside Pakistan, her brother had previously claimed that she is a beneficiary of property in London.
He further pointed out that in the 2023 nomination papers, Maryam Nawaz had listed four individuals (Muhammad Safdar, Meheru Nisa Safdar, Muhammad Junaid Safdar, and Mah Noor Safdar) as dependents in her affidavits. However, in 2024, she omitted mentioning her children in the affidavit.
Referring to Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, which disqualifies individuals not meeting the criteria of being sadiq and ameen from contesting the 2024 elections, he requested the admission of his appeal and the rejection of the nomination papers.
 
Imran Khan
Meanwhile, an appellate election tribunal dismissed PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan's appeal against the RO's decision to reject his nomination papers from NA-122.
The tribunal upheld the RO's ruling, which cited Imran's disqualification under Article 63 (1)(h) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, along with section 232 of the Election Act 2017, due to "the candidate being convicted by a court of law."
Furthermore, the RO considered another ground for rejection, stating that "the proposer of the candidate is not a registered voter in constituency NA-122, as per section 60(1) of the Election Act 2017."
As for the Pervez Elahi and Moonis Elahi, the concerned appellate election tribunal while announcing a reserved decision dismissed appeals of the PTI’s former chief minister and his son against the orders of ROs wherein their nomination papers were rejected from constituencies NA-64, NA-69 and PP-32 and PP-34.
The Punjab Food Authority (PFA) discarded 1,900 litres of adulterated and substandard milk on Wednesday, as part of an ongoing operation against subpar milk in the provincial metropolis. 
On the directions of PFA Director General Muhammad Asim Javaid, dairy safety teams inspected milk-carrying vehicles, dairy units and milk shops to ensure the provision of pure and fresh milk to consumers. DG PFA said that teams placed screening pickets at three different points of Lahore including Babu Sabu, Saggiyan Bridge and Ravi Toll Plaza on Wednesday.

The authority inspected over 50 milk-carrying vehicles loaded with a total of over 41,000 litres of milk. He added that teams took action against milk suppliers and discarded over 1,900 litres of milk after screening test results were not up to the mark. The samples of discarded milk contained polluted water, a low level of fats and a lack of nutritional value in the milk. 
DG Muhammad Asim said that indiscriminate action would continue until the elimination of the milk-adulteration mafia across Punjab. He added that citizens could get milk tested free of cost by visiting the nearest PFA office with a sample of 200ml of raw milk.

Due to the extreme cold weather in Punjab, the provincial government has extended by a week the winter vacations for playgroup to Class I in the schools because of harsh weather and health risks.
However, the schools will remain open for the higher classes in accordance with a new timetable issued by the authorities. On the other hand, on the first day after the winter vacations, low attendance of the students was recorded due to the cold weather. A large number of children were reportedly suffering from diseases caused by the cold weather.
The extreme cold weather and proliferation of diseases, including pneumonia, fever, flu and chest infection among young students forced the Punjab government to extend for seven more days the winter holidays for the pre-class to Cass I students in the public and private sector schools. 
The decision was taken after the first day following the reopening of schools, in view of reports regarding health risks to young children due to the harsh cold weather conditions and low attendance in the classes. The schools across Punjab opened on Wednesday after three-week winter vacations. 
According to Punjab Teachers Union Secretary General Rana Liaqat Ali, around 40 per cent students were absent on first day of school after the vacations. 
Health experts say lack of rainfall has turned the weather harsh with a spike in diseases caused by smog and fog. Several big cities of the province are experiencing a long spell of fog. 
Citing inadequate infrastructure, school administrators had been asking the Punjab government to take steps to provide facilities to protect the children from the cold weather.
"Attendance was low in the schools and the teachers also faced difficulties in continuing the classes for little kids in the prevailing conditions. We have no facilities of heating in the classrooms and the reason is simply lack of funds,” Rana Liaqat said while speaking to The Express Tribune.
He urged the government to release funds to the schools to purchase heaters and also make adequate arrangements in the rural areas.
“We also don not have the facilities for taking care of students feeling unwell and it would be better for them to stay home,” he added.
The parents also faced hardship in dropping their children at schools in the morning, especially in the remote districts.
"Thousands of students go to schools on local buses, while a majority of them travel on motorbikes. In this cold season the critical issue is the lack of facilities in the government schools,” said a schoolteacher in Narowal district, Qamer Khan.
Meanwhile, Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi said while speaking to the media that a ban had also been imposed on morning assemblies throughout the ongoing month.
He said there was an alarming situation at the Children's Hospital, where a number of kids had succumbed to pneumonia since January 1. 
Naqvi likened the spread of pneumonia to the coronavirus and urged parents to be vigilant about their children's diet and health. He announced an imminent awareness campaign against pneumonia. 
Highlighting the severity of the cold weather, he urged the elderly citizens to prioritise their diet and attire. 
Mask-wearing was declared mandatory in schools and specific guidelines issued to combat the disease. 
He assured the public that the health and school departments were diligently addressing the situation, with daily feedback from a committee.

For jailed convicts accustomed to a life of crime and deviance, reintegrating into a decorous society is a task requiring stupendous perseverance, even more so for inmates serving sentences in Punjab’s jails, who in the absence of behavior correction programs, leave prison cells only to return to their earlier offensives with reinvigorated resilience.
Where nations across the globe heavily invest in the education and instruction of prisoners serving terms inside jails in an attempt to prepare them for a new life of propriety and dignity after their release, inmates within Punjab’s largest jail network facing a variety of charges are denied basic didactic coaching and skills training, leading human behavior experts to deduce that the life of freedom awaiting most outcasts beyond the threshold of the jail premises would be far more unforgiving than their time behind bars.
“Until or unless the prisoners in jails are given adequate counselling and training, they can never lead normal lives after their release. But unfortunately, no such coaching system exists in the jails of Punjab for prisoners who are denied a chance at becoming better citizens. Therefore, in most cases, these prisoners return to their criminal activities soon after leaving jail,” expressed Dr Shahzad Tahir, a Professor of Psychology, who advised the government to introduce reform houses within jails, which conduct weekly lectures for inculcating moral values among inmates. 
According to sources obtained by The Express Tribune, a negligible number of correctional facilities exist across 43 jails in Punjab which despite holding more than 55,000 prisoners including 52,000 men, 1,000 women, 700 children, 3,800 accused, 1,400 convicts and more than 400 death row prisoners, have only 32 teachers available for giving basic ethical instruction to prisoners or their children.
Moreover, the nugatory didactic and vocational training that prisoners receive in these jails is either funded by a private non-governmental organization (NGO), a company or a welfare organization. This is evident in the fact that ever since Masjid/Maktab schools were closed in jails, the only kind of coaching available to inmates was technical and was offered by companies like Toyota however, the efficacy of such schemes was dubious in nature.

Unsurprisingly, even when some religious and ethical training was given in jails, a shortage of teachers prevented any serious improvements in the intellectual and social development of inmates since 40 per cent of the posts for Arabic, ethics and psychology teachers were reportedly vacant.
“The scope of our work is limited, therefore, we only offer coaching to children and young girls in the hopes of improving their future prospects,” said Syeda Farah Hashmi, a teacher working at a jail.
Given the dire absence of teaching facilities in jails, some prisoners who aspire to achieve erudition study on their own and complete their intermediate, bachelor’s or master’s degrees through the Allama Iqbal Open University.
“The sentence of any prisoner who receives worldly or religious education is waived by 15 days to two years,” informed Inspector General Prisons Punjab Mian Farooq Nazir. 
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Special Secretary Home Department Fazalur Rehman said, “Many NGOs in jails are running schools offering courses of matriculation, intermediate, bachelors, masters and Quranic education. We plan to introduce a correctional facility in jails soon.”

In a surprising development, the nomination papers of prominent Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders were approved, stipulating the political bigwigs into the election arena.
The nomination papers of former ministers and assembly members were initially rejected by returning officers, but the latest development has caused a significant political stir as these candidates re-entered the election arena.
A total of 165 appeals were filed for national and provincial seats in Rawalpindi district, along with two national and four provincial seats in Mianwali. Among them, 103 appeals were approved, 56 were rejected, and six were withdrawn.

Renowned wildlife and animal behaviour expert, Dr Ijaz Ahmed, emphasised the imperative need to not just consider the well-being of animals as a moral obligation but as a fundamental right within our society.
He asserted that animals, like humans, experience pain and deserve to have their intrinsic rights acknowledged. In a call for a societal mind-set shift, he urged the public to recognise the emotional capacity of animals and their right to coexist in human societies with dignity and respect.
However, it’s disheartening to witness the widespread use of animals for entertainment, particularly in circuses and amusement parks. Expressing concern over the gradual disappearance of animal biodiversity in Pakistan, Dr Ahmed highlighted the alarming consequences of depleting jungle cover. As these natural habitats diminish, countless species face the threat of losing their homes.
He further said that the diminishing jungles also result in a decline in biodiversity, particularly affecting Pakistan’s aquatic ecosystems. He emphasised the necessity of protecting aquatic animals, underscoring the importance of preserving their habitats for the benefit of future generations.

As diverse species face a decline, he underscored the urgency of educating the younger generation so as to instil a sense of responsibility in them. Additionally, he emphasises the need to preserve natural habitats and establish wildlife sanctuaries as crucial steps towards conserving Pakistan’s rich and diverse wildlife.
A prominent animal rights activist, Anees Jilani, urged for a comprehensive overhaul of Pakistan's antiquated animal rights laws to align them with contemporary societal values. The existing laws, such as the 1890 Act under which the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) have proven ineffective and are in desperate need of reform.
Anees Jilani shed light on some key provisions of the outdated act, emphasising that it criminalises cruelty to animals, including baiting or inciting animals to fight. He said that there was a dire need to resuscitate the neglected laws.

The ironing machine is an essential household item which serves as a basic necessity in every home. However, Sher Muhammad of Patiala still runs his business by taking it upon himself to iron people’s clothes with his hand-crafted coal-powered iron at a nominal fee.
It can be said that iron plays an important role in shaping people’s personality and surely, no one prefers to leave the house wearing clothes lined with creases. However, ironing can be a time-consuming task that may prove a challenge, especially in the case of smoothing out clothes fashioned from different kinds of fabric.
This is where Sher Muhammad comes in. A 75-year-old man from Patiala near Saidpuri Gate – the densest area of Rawalpindi – makes both ends meet by using a charcoal iron to provide ironing services to locals of the area and has been doing so for the past 70 years.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Sher Muhammad said “Our forefathers belong to Patiala, and we used to live in Saidpuri Gate before Pakistan was founded.”
He says before the creation of Pakistan, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were living happily in one neighbourhood. “When the movement for Pakistan started, the desire for a separate homeland arose in our hearts. I participated in the movement,” he elaborated while sharing his life story.
Sher Muhammad explained that in the earlier days Kartarpura, Saidpuri Gate, Bhapara Bazaar, Haripur, and Bagh Sardaran were areas within old Rawalpindi that had central status. In these areas, resided the famous traders.

Hindu and Sikh traders mostly wore white clothes and shawls and warm woollen clothes in the winter, while women used to wear silk, banarsi and cotton sarees. He said, “When I started my service, I used to iron shalwar kameez for one rupee.”
My iron was made of a block of iron worth Rs200, he said adding that irons like these are no longer manufactured and coal has also become expensive. “Now I charge Rs100 to iron a pair of shalwar kameez. I iron the clothes of twenty-five houses in the neighbourhood and I have raised my children with the help of this iron,” he exclaimed.
Sher Muhammad has three children. His eldest son has died, while two of his children work hard to run the household. His children are the ones who pay the ironing store’s rent which costs Rs5,000 per month.
In the past, clothes were ironed on special occasions such as Eid or other festivals. However, people are now in the habit of regularly ironing clothes and they prefer to use an ironing machine made of iron. The main reason for this is that the weight of a machine made of iron helps press and smooth out fabric so that it gives the cloth a sheen of its own.

Commissioner Chattha while commenting on the latest initiative said the Vehicle Inspection Centres will remain operational seven days a week for the fitness certification of these vehicles.
According to citizens, motorcycle rickshaws have become a major cause of accidents and pollution in the city due to weak regulation by the departments concerned.

A traders, Daniyal, informed the Jatli police team over the phone that the incident occurred when over 40 traders were on their way to the Lahore cattle market via the Peshawar Motorway in public transport.

The affected traders said that they had reported the incident to Rescue 15, on which a preliminary report was lodged at the Jatli police station, Rawalpindi. The police also visited the crime scene, inspected the bus and directed all the affected traders to reach Jatli police station. 
When the victims reached the Jatli police station, the police officials said that the incident on GT Road did not take place in the limits of Rawalpindi district but in Chakwal district, therefore, the traders should go to Chakwal and get their report registered there.
The affected traders were standing outside the Jatali police station in the bitter cold and were in distress by the indifference of the police. 
The traders demanded that action should be taken by taking notice of the improper behaviour of the police.
The Rawalpindi Police spokesman said that the robbery incident took place in the Dhok Amb area of Chakwal district.
However, the Jatli police had rushed to the spot after receiving the information about the incident but after investigation, they found out that the area falls within the limits of Chakwal. The case of the incident will be registered by District Chakwal police.

PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan on Wednesday expressed the party’s intent to apply for a postal ballot provision should Imran Khan remain imprisoned during the elections.
"We're exploring the option of seeking permission for postal ballots if Imran Khan's release isn’t secured before the elections," he said while speaking to the media following his meeting with the former prime minister in Adiala Jail.
He shared that discussions with the PTI's founding chairman regarding the allocation of party tickets were underway, adding that the process would be completed on Thursday (today).
Candidates from constituencies across Pakistan would be actively involved in the electoral contest, he assured.
Barrister Gohar Khan hailed the Peshawar High Court's (PHC) decision to reinstate the bat symbol, declaring it a symbol of the party’s victory.
He criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), alleging deliberate obstruction in returning the symbol to PTI, portraying it not just as a PTI symbol but as a representation of the people's rights in Pakistan.
He further alleged that the attempts to snatch the bat symbol threatened the integrity of upcoming elections, fostering an environment ripe for corruption.
Touching upon the intra-party polls that resulted in his chairmanship, Barrister Gohar noted that no other party has held such transparent polls.
He announced the release of finalised candidate lists and dismissed any insinuations of favouritism in the ticket allocation process, assuring that all information would be shared with the media.
"To ensure fair representation, committees have been established at various levels for ticket allocation," he said.
On the subject of the ongoing cypher case, he expressed optimism about the court providing relief and ensuring an open trial.
The officials of the climate change ministry on Wednesday informed a Senate panel that Indus River had turned into the second most polluted one in the world as the drainage water of 388 cities of Pakistan fell directly into it.
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change presided by Senator Seemee Ezdi was held at the Parliament House. Ezdi said when she returned to the federal capital from Karachi, she was surprised to see fog at the Islamabad airport.
“Islamabad has never seen such intense fog before,” she added. Pakistan Meteorological Department Director General Mahr Sahibzad Khan told the committee that fog had increased in Islamabad because of the lack of rains in December.

He continued that the probability of rain this year would be more in the coming days. He told the panel that there were likely to be more rains in the last week of January. Khan explained that smog was formed by the toxic substance of different gases.
He attributed 45% of smog to smoke emitted by vehicles. Senator Farooq Hamid Naek said fog occurred all over the world but Pakistan was responsible for the smog itself. He pointed out that the coal plant installed in Sahiwal was also causing smog. He noted that the coal for this plant came from Karachi.
“It would have been better if it [coal plant] had been installed next to Karachi,” he added. Climate Change Secretary Asif Hyder Shah told the committee that that the intensity of cold in Islamabad in January this year had decreased than what it was in the past.

“All these are the effects of climate change. Now we have to decide how to deal with it,” he continued. The official said at the recent 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Pakistan faced a lot of pressure for using coal plants but they presented their arguments.
He added that it took 30 years for developed countries to reach a stage where they could use other sources of energy. However, the official conceded that eventually the country would also have to opt for alternative energy sources,
He stressed the need to stop burning crop waste in fields to combat smog. The officials of the climate change ministry said five brick kilns were closed in Islamabad, They added that some brick kilns had been changed to zigzag method.
The officials said climate change also had negative economic effects, stressing the need for oil refineries to use quality oil.
In light of the Supreme Court's directives, Defence Secretary Lt Gen (retd) Hamooduz Zaman Khan has sent letters to the three services chiefs to take action against the officers and personnel involved in the case of the 2017 Faizabad sit-in staged by the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
In his written statement submitted to a three-member Faizabad sit-in inquiry commission, the defence secretary said he had written letters to the chiefs of army, navy and air force to take action against the officers and personnel involved in the TLP demonstration.
The commission, formed to identify those who planned, financed, and supported the sit-in at Islamabad’s Faizabad around six years back, has already questioned former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, ex-chairman of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) Absar Alam and former inspector general of police Punjab Arif Nawaz.
The body had also summoned PML-N president and former premier Shehbaz Sharif on January 3 in his capacity as the ex-chief minister of Punjab. However, Shehbaz failed to appear before the commission and asked it to send him a questionnaire pertaining to the inquiry they wanted to conduct.
The inquiry body has to submit its report to the top court on January 22.
It will also recommend legal actions against those who both planned and executed the protest.
Earlier, former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed submitted his written statement to the commission.
While giving his statement, Faiz answered the questions given by the commission, in which he said that he had negotiated with the TLP on the instructions of the government.
Faiz denied the allegations of any conspiracy against the government.
Constituted under Section 3 of the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act, 2017, the commission is led by Syed Akhtar Ali Shah, a former civil servant, who also served as the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa police chief.
It also comprises Tahir Alam Khan, also a former police officer, and Khushal Khan, an additional secretary at the interior ministry.
The TLP, then led by Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi, had staged the sit-in in protest against the changes made in the lawmakers’ oath, affirming their belief that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the last messenger of God.
As a result of the protest, the PML-N government had to sack its law minister Zahid Hamid. The Supreme Court had taken suo motu notice of the sit-in on Nov 21, 2017.
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Wednesday directed pointed jibes at the PML-N and PTI, asserting that his party was the sole contender in the political arena while "those said to be heavyweights" remain conspicuously absent from the scene.
Addressing his supporters following a dinner gathering with party workers from constituency NA-127 in Lahore, the former foreign minister emphasised the significance of the event, aimed at acquainting the people of Lahore, Punjab, with PPP’s dedicated workers “and to demonstrate our readiness for the contest”.
Deriding PML-N's claims of dominance in the region, he noted that the party was nowhere to be seen while its candidates remained unknown. He further questioned the purported influence of PTI in Lahore, urging the public to evaluate the reality of PTI's stronghold in the city. “The PPP is the sole party that is ready to contest the elections in Lahore.”
Bilawal also announced that Misbah ur Rehman has agreed to contest the elections from Lahore, emerging as the candidate for PP-160. Besides, the PPP finalised Faisal Mir as its candidate for PP-161. Similarly, Manzar Abbas Khokhar, formerly associated with PML-N and now a member of PPP, has been chosen to represent the Party in PP-162.

Chairman Bilawal extended a warm welcome to Mr Bhatti, formerly a PTI ticket holder, who has switched allegiance to PPP. He will now stand as the PPP candidate for PP-163. In addition, Mr Gurkhi has been selected to represent the PPP in PP-157. Chairman Bilawal highlighted that this constitutes the PPP's electoral panel from NA-127.
Expressing confidence in implementing the PPP's message of unity and harmony, he affirmed the party’s commitment to commence this endeavour from NA-127. “We have to bury the conflicts within to work under the flag of the PPP, and strive for the sake of the ‘arrow’ and Quaid-e-Awam Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, to show the world that Lahore was, is and will forever belong to the Bhuttos.”
Bilawal emphasized, "We're not easily intimidated; we have never yielded to tyranny and remain steadfastly dedicated to serving the nation's people. Our party’s workers must reach every doorstep, spreading our message and the 10-point socioeconomic contract with the citizens."
He pledged to the people that if entrusted with the chance to lead as their prime minister, he would commit to doubling people's salaries within five years, ensuring 300 units of free electricity, and securing free, high-quality education for the youth. He expressed his desire to replicate the establishment of world-class healthcare facilities, free of charge, in Lahore and across Punjab, similar to the successful model implemented in Sindh.

“We will also build three million houses for our poor brothers and give the ownership to the women of the households. It's crucial that the arrow is stamped on election day to make this a reality,” he said. Moreover, the onus is on the workers of the party to visit areas with temporary housing and tell them that the PPP government will regularise their housing.
“We will not only expand the Benazir Income Support Programme but facilitate our farmers and workers through the ‘Benazir Mazdoor Card’ and ‘Benazir Kissan Card’.” Chairman Bilawal directed the workers to apprise the youth of the PPP’s ‘Youth Card’, the aspiration behind which is to help them prosper by supporting them financially. “We also aim to eradicate hunger, for which we will initiate the ‘Bhook Mitao Programme’.”
He further said that he vows to ensure that the plethora of issues faced by the people are addressed, be it poverty, unemployment or inflation. “The PPP does not believe in the politics of hate and division, and it wishes to put an end to the traditional form of politics. We wish to introduce a new form of politics, that forgoes the personal vendettas and egoism.”
The elections are to take place on February 8, he added. Taking a jibe at the PML-N once again, he said that the PML-N has made a habit of running from the elections, be it the local government elections, by-elections or general elections.“The people now have to show the PML-N that the elections will take place on February 8 and it has nowhere to run. The PPP will be victorious and change the destiny of the people,” he asserted.
Amid mounting criticism over the delay in its election strategy and ticket allocations, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Wednesday not only unveiled plans to kickstart its electoral campaign on January 15 but also finalised the distribution of party tickets across 21 districts, including Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.
This update was confirmed at the time of this report's filing. As per the party's notification, PML-N distributed National Assembly tickets and provincial assembly seats among candidates hailing from 21 districts. The recipients spanned Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Nankana Sahib, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Chiniot, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, Sialkot, Jhelum, Chakwal, Talagang, Attock, Narowal, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad, Kasur, Sahiwal, Okara, Pakpattan, and Hafizabad.
The party seems to have reserved certain seats for potential adjustments with other parties, such as NA-64 Gujrat and two provincial seats under it for PML-N.
As per PML-N leader Abid Raza, the party has allocated NA-64 to Chaudhary Salik Hussain, along with the two associated seats for his party, as part of honouring their commitment.
A surprise inclusion in the allocations was NA-75 (Narowal) being awarded to Chaudhry Anwar Iqbal, which meant that Danyal Aziz was given the boot due to his criticisms against his constituency colleague, Ahsan Iqbal. Contrary to earlier predictions, Ahsan Iqbal not only secured a ticket for NA-76 but also for PP-54.
PML-N also kept its promise to former National Assembly opposition leader Raja Raiz, acknowledging his assistance in allowing PML-N to govern with no checks on it during his tenure as a sham opposition leader. After the conclusion of his assembly term, Raja joined PML-N.
In order to accommodate Raja and company, the party had to ditch its leader Rana Ehsan Afzal. Raja was accommodated on NA-104, while PML-N leader Chaudhry Abid Sher Ali secured NA-102 and Rana Sanaullah claimed NA-100.
Talal Chaudhry is expected to be ditched in a constituency which is yet to be announced.
The party accommodated all its old guards in key NA seats in Toba Tek Singh, such as Chaudhary Khalid Javed on NA-105 and Colonel (retd) Ayub Gadhi on PP-112.
In Jhang, PML-N welcomed a new entrant, Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat, who received tickets for NA-108 and PP-125. In Sheikhupura, Rana Tanveer secured the party ticket for NA-114 and PP-139, while Javed Latif obtained the ticket for NA-115.
Chaudhry Muhammad Barjees Tahir was given the NA-111 ticket in Nankana Sahib. In Chiniot, PML-N allocated NA-93 to Syed Muhammad Raza Bukhari and NA-94 to Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh. Meanwhile, in Gujranwala, the party granted NA-78 to senior leader Khurram Dastaghir Khan.
The party allocated the following tickets in various constituencies: Sheikh Aftab Ahmed for NA-49 (Attock), Malik Sohail Khan for NA-50 (Attock), Raja Osama Sarwar for NA-51 (Rawalpindi), Raja Muhammad Javeed Ikhlas for NA-52 (Rawalpindi), Raja Qamar Ul Islam for NA-53 (Rawalpindi), Malik Ibrar Ahmad for NA-55 (Rawalpindi), Muhammad Haneef Abbassi for NA-56 (Rawalpindi), Danyal Chaudary for NA-57 (Rawalpindi), Major (retd) Tahir Iqbal for NA-58 (Chakwal), and Sardar Ghullam Abbass for NA-59 (Talagang).
PML-N leader Bilal Yasin secured a PP-6 ticket from Rawalpindi. In addition, PML-N announced the commencement of its election rallies starting on January 15.
Pakistan on Tuesday warned that failure of international efforts to halt the "brutal" Israeli war on Gaza risked escalation that could engulf the entire region, as the UN General Assembly debated the use of the veto by the United States in the Security Council last month.
“The council has been paralysed due to the resistance and negative vote of a permanent member,” Ambassador Usman Jadoon, acting permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 193-member Assembly -- without naming the US.
“A heavy responsibility rests on those who have enabled the prolongation of this war and the continuing slaughter of innocent civilians in Gaza,” the Pakistani envoy pointed out.
The veto is a special voting power held by the permanent members on the Council, whereby if any one of the five - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - casts a negative vote, the resolution or decision automatically fails.
Tuesday's meeting was held under the Assembly's standing mandate to convene within 10 working days of a veto being cast in the Council. “Beyond the imperative of an immediate and sustainable ceasefire, we must ensure the provision of adequate humanitarian assistance to the besieged population of Gaza,” the Pakistani envoy said, upholding the peoples' right to life and dignity.

There must be consequences and accountability for Israel’s criminal actions in Palestine, the Pakistani envoy said. In this regard, he said Pakistan welcomed South Africa’s initiative to bring Israel's transgressions under the Genocide Convention to the Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Pakistan, he added, also looks forward to the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. “The root cause of this crisis lies in Israel's prolonged occupation and denial of Palestinians' inalienable right to self-determination. Israel's brutal campaign against the occupied people of Palestine struggling for their freedom cannot be justified under the guise of self-defence,” Jadoon said.
“The international community cannot accept the fait accompli Israel is seeking to impose to destroy Palestinian nationhood,” he said.
“The choice before us regarding Palestine is stark: engage in a determined and sustained diplomatic endeavour to implement the two-state solution, or bear witness to the ongoing genocide perpetrated by extremist Israeli leaders, with the tacit or explicit support of some foreign political leaders.”
in the end, the Pakistani envoy called for working collectively to prevent the genocide in Palestine, achieve a two state solution and establish a secure, viable, contiguous, and sovereign state of Palestine on the basis of the pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.

On Dec 22, the United States vetoed an amendment proposed by Russia that would have called for "an urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access”. Subsequently, the 15-member Council adopted a watered-down resolution calling for speeding aid deliveries to desperate civilians in Gaza but without the original plea for an “urgent suspension of hostilities” between Israel and the Palestinian fighters.
The vote was 13 in favour to none against, with 2 abstentions (United States, Russian Federation).  In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said that the Council has regrettably failed in fulfilling its obligation to impose a ceasefire. “Pakistan, therefore, reiterates its call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire,” Ambassador Jadoon said, highlighting that Israel's war in Gaza is brutal -- a veritable genocide.
“This latest exercise of the veto reinforces our conviction that the reform of the Security Council should not add more permanent members to its composition,” he said, referring to the push by India, Brazil, Germany and Japan for permanent seats in an expanded Security Council --  a move Pakistan and its allies stoutly oppose.
“Israel's indiscriminate slaughter of innocent Palestinian civilians, including children and women, is a flagrant violation of international law, including the principles of the UN Charter, international humanitarian and human rights law," Jadoon said, adding that this genocidal war must be stopped forthwith in accordance with the General Assembly's resounding call for an immediate and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire.
“Pakistan strongly and unequivocally condemns Israel's rejection of a humanitarian ceasefire,” he said. 
The Supreme Court has held that declaring certain provisions of the Army Act as unconstitutional would not affect the cases of civilians who have already been convicted by military courts.
“Cases of persons convicted by court martial and who have either (i) served out the sentence, or (ii) who are serving the sentence but have exhausted legal remedies and/or whose convictions have otherwise become final, shall be regarded as past and closed, and remain unaffected by this judgment,” reads a 78-page detailed judgment authored by Justice Munib Akhtar against the trials of civilians in military courts.
A five-judge bench of the apex court led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan on Oct 23, 2023 declared that the trials of 103 civilians in military courts were unconstitutional. The bench also held that Clause (d) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Army Act [in both of its sub clauses (i) & (ii)] and subsection (4) of Section 59 of the Army Act are ultra vires the Constitution and of no legal effect.
"Although we have made the declaration in para (i) of the short order regarding the vires of the impugned provisions, it must also be recognised that a very great many civilians have been already been convicted and sentenced by courts martial in terms thereof.
“Some regard must be given to this reality and some arrangements made in this regard. Accordingly, it is directed in relation to certain categories of cases as below", says the judgment.
The judgment clarified that the persons, who have been convicted by court martial and who are still pursuing legal remedies (whether statutory or before a court of law) may apply to the appropriate court, which shall consider the lawfulness of the conviction without reference to this judgment, but if it concludes that the person is otherwise entitled to any relief (including, but not limited to, with regard to the sentence) may, in the facts and circumstances of the case before it, also take this judgment into consideration.
The court also said that neither a petition filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution nor a petition before the president under Article 45 of the Constitution or any provision of law whereby relief equivalent to the latter “can be sought (other legal remedies having been exhausted) shall be regarded as a pending, or (as the case may be) the pursuing of a, legal remedy".
"Any person or class of persons for whom a special remedy has been created by law to a court outside the Army Act or equivalent laws (whether by way of a right of review or re-consideration or otherwise) shall, whether convicted or still being tried by court martial, seek his remedy accordingly, and his case shall remain unaffected by this judgment."
“In view of this clarification, conviction awarded Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav will not be affected”.
Justice Ayesha Malik, in her additional note, said that the military trials of civilians on the other hand totally negates the requirement of an independent and impartial judicial forum, hence, it compromises the right to fair trial. Citizens enjoy the protection of fundamental rights under the Constitution and are assured that they will be treated as per law, such that their life and dignity is protected.
"At the same time, the Constitution commands the legislature to not make law which takes away any fundamental right protected under the Constitution. In this context, the requirement of the Federal Government to try civilians before military courts totally defies the constitutional command and is in derogation to the rights contained in Articles 4, 9, 10A, 14 read with Article 175 of the Constitution," said Justice Ayesha.
Unlike the majority opinion, another member of the bench, Justice Yahya Afridi, did not declare certain provisions of the Army Act to try the civilians in military courts as unconstitutional. "While sitting on a bench of five Judges, I am bound by what was decided in F.B. Ali case, wherein, after testing the provisions of sections  & (ii) and 59(4) of the Army Act on the touchstone of the fundamental rights agitated before the court in the present cases, the Court adjudged them to be intra vires the Constitution, and not violative of articles 9, 10A, and 25 of the Constitution.”
Justice Afridi did not give definite finding and held that the contentions of the counsel for the petitioners, as to reconsidering the law declared in F.B. All case “is undoubtedly legally and constitutionally very weighty, and thus, make a prima facia case, warranting to be considered and decided by a larger bench of more than eight judges of this court, as was right constituted at the commencement of the proceedings of the present cases”.
The preliminary lists of candidates will be released by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday, and candidates can opt to withdraw their nomination papers until Friday (tomorrow).
According to the election supervisor spokesperson, the process of hearing appeals against the acceptance or rejection of nomination papers by the appellate tribunals for the general elections 2024 concluded on Wednesday. These tribunals are being headed by judges of the high courts.
Electoral symbols will be assigned on Saturday, coinciding with the release of the final list of candidates on the same day. The general elections are set for the 8th of the next month.
Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi is not the first superior court judge to resign from his position in view of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) proceedings. So far, seven judges of the apex court, including Justice Naqvi, have resigned before completion of their terms for a variety of reasons. The number of such high court judges is ten.
In October 2016, Iqbal Hameedur Rahman, a judge of the Supreme Court, resigned from his position after an SC bench invalidated the 74 appointments made to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) while Justice Rahman served at the capital's high court as the chief justice.
In 2001, Justice Rashid Aziz resigned over allegations of bias in a corruption case against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. In the same year, Justice Malik Muhammad Qayyum of the Lahore High Court (LHC) also left his post due to allegations of bias in the Benazir Bhutto corruption case.
Two Supreme Court judges—Fakir Muhammad Khokhar and Javed Buttar—tendered their resignations on August 6, 2009. These judges had taken an oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) promulgated by General Pervez Musharraf on November 3, 2007.

Justice Khokhar and Justice Buttar resigned after a 14-member SC bench declared the imposition of the November 3, 2007 emergency and subsequent actions as unconstitutional and void on July 31, 2009. The bench held that judges who took an oath under the PCO would be tried in the SJC for committing judicial misconduct.
Two days earlier, on August 4, 2009, BHC Chief Justice Amanullah Khan Yasinzai and four other judges—Justice Ahmed Khan Lashari, Justice Akhtar Zaman Malghani, Justice Nadir Khan Durrani, and Justice Mehta Kalash Nath Kohli—also resigned following the SC order. These BHC judges had also taken oaths of office under the PCO.
In April 2019, Justice Farrukh Irfan of the LHC resigned after a reference was filed against him in the SJC due to his name emerging in the Panama Papers leak. In February 2017, Justice Mazhar Iqbal Siddiqui of the LHC resigned due to proceedings initiated in the SCJ based on corruption allegations.
In May 2015, Justice Muhammad Tasnim of the Sindh High Court resigned for personal reasons. During General Yahya Khan's era, Justice Fazal Ghani of the LHC faced a reference in the SJC, and upon the arrival of the reference against him, he resigned from his position. In contrast, former chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar released pensions amounting to millions to the judges who had taken an oath under the PCO.
The electoral lists prepared by the country’s citizens’ registration body--the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA)—for at least four districts of the country contain glaring discrepancies.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after detecting these errors has returned these faulty lists to NADRA for their rectification, official sources revealed to The Express Tribune on Wednesday.
They said NADRA has made several errors in the pictorial electoral rolls for women and men voters. In North Waziristan, Orakzai, Tando Allahyar, and Quetta, women voters were included in men's rolls, while men voters were placed in women's rolls.
Concerns about potential complications during the voting process due to these inaccurate entries in the electoral lists have prompted the ECP to instruct NADRA to rectify these errors.

As per the sources, in case the electoral lists are not corrected by February 8, the election day, men voters will cast their votes with women voters in the four districts.
An electoral list, also known as an electoral roll or voter list, is a comprehensive roster or database containing the names and details of eligible voters within a particular jurisdiction, such as a district, constituency, or region.
This list typically includes information like names, addresses, and sometimes other details like identification numbers or photographs of registered voters.
It serves as a fundamental tool during elections, ensuring that eligible citizens can exercise their right to vote by verifying their registration status and eligibility at polling stations.
• Adverse ruling in case brought by South Africa may have ‘significant symbolic’ impact
• Blinken presses Tel Aviv to avoid harming civilians in Gaza
THE HAGUE: Israel and South Africa face off at the UN’s top court from Thursday, after Pretoria accused Israel of “genocidal acts” in Gaza, charges the Israelis have dismissed as “blood libel”.
In an 84-page submission to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa urged judges to order Israel to “immediately suspend its military operations” in Gaza.
South Africa alleges that Israel “has engaged in, is engaging in, and risks further engaging in genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza”.
Israel has angrily hit back at the accusations, with government spokesman Eylon Levy vowing to fight the South African case he described as “absurd blood libel”.
Top officials from the two countries will face off in the ICJ’s Great Hall of Justice housed in the extravagant Peace Palace in The Hague.
 






The ICJ rules on disputes between states and while its decisions are legally binding, it has limited power to enforce them. The court could in theory order Israel to stop its invasion but it is highly doubtful it would be obeyed.
In March 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to “immediately suspend” its invasion of Ukraine — a directive Moscow has ignored. Johann Soufi, a lawyer and international justice expert, said there would be an “extremely significant symbolic impact” if the court ruled against Israel.
“Of course there is the problem of implementing the decision. But at the end of the day, international justice is all there is left,” said Soufi, who worked for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza.
’Criminally complicit
South Africa has filed the case against Israel because both countries have signed the UN Genocide Convention, created in 1948 as a response to the Holocaust.
Any country that has signed the convention can sue another at the ICJ if they disagree on the “interpretation, application or fulfilment” of the rules designed to prevent genocide.
South Africa said it was “acutely aware of the particular weight of responsibility in initiating proceedings against Israel for violations of the Genocide Convention”. It also “unequivocally” condemned the Hamas attack, but said “no armed attack… no matter how serious… can provide any possible justification for breaches” of the Genocide Convention.
Pretoria’s case is that Israeli action in Gaza is “intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”. It says Israel’s “genocidal acts” stem from the killing of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, forced displacement, and preventing adequate aid access, resulting in starvation.
 






South Africa wants the ICJ to impose so-called “provisional measures”, or emergency actions, while the broader case is being considered — which would probably take years.
Other measures requested by South Africa include reparations and reconstruction of Gaza, plus the safe return of displaced Palestinian refugees.
Blinken
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged Israeli leaders to avoid harming civilians and told them creation of a Palestinian state was the key to a long-term solution.
Blinken is on his fourth visit to the Middle East since Israel began its offensive against Gaza in October.
 






The Israeli air and ground assault has now killed 23,210 Palestinians and international concern is mounting.
Blinken met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Tel Aviv’s Kirya military base, and then with Netanyahu’s war cabinet.
The US diplomat stressed “the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
Earlier, Blinken held talks in Jordan, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and said that Washington’s Arab allies wanted closer relations with Israel but only if that included a “practical pathway” to a Palestinian state.

MADRID: At least 6,618 migrants died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain by sea in 2023, when record numbers headed for the Canary Islands, a migr­ants’ rights group said on Tuesday.
This “shameful” figure is almost three times the number recorded in the previous year — 2,390 — and the highest since charity Caminando Front­eras, or Walking Borders, began keeping a tally in 2007, its coordinator, Helena Maleno, told a news conference.
The total includes 384 children, according to the organisation, which compiles its figures from families of migrants who died or went missing and from official rescue statistics.
Maleno blamed the rise in migrant deaths and disappearances last year on a lack of resources for rescuers. Nearly half involved migrants who had departed for Spain from Senegal.
The vast majority of fatalities — 6,007 — took place on the Atlantic migration route.
 






The number of migrants arriving illegally in Spain in 2023 nearly doubled from the previous year, reaching 56,852, according to interior ministry figures.
That was the highest number since 2018, when 64,298 migrants entered the country.
The majority, about 70 per cent, arrived in the Canary Islands, which, at their closest point, are barely 100km from the northwest coast of Africa.
‘Saved lives’
The direct journey from Senegal to the Canaries usually takes a week of difficult upwind sailing of around 1,600km.
Spain’s central government in October pledged an aid package worth 50 million euros ($54m) to help the archipelago cope with the surge in arrivals.
Spanish Interior Minis­ter Fernando Grande-Marlaska said on Thursday this cooperation with African nations had stopped the departure of more than 27,000 would-be migrants to Spain last year.
“We have saved lives,” he claimed.

Gabriel Attal

 
PARIS: French leader Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday picked Gabriel Attal as prime minister in a bid to give new momentum to his presidency, with the 34-year-old becoming France’s youngest and first openly gay head of government. 
Following days of speculation, Macron late Monday accepted the resignation of Elisabeth Borne, 62, who stepped down along with the rest of the government after serving less than two years in office. 
The overhaul comes ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris and European parliament elections this summer, where Macron’s centrist forces risk defeat at the hands of the far-right under Marine Le Pen. 
A wider cabinet reshuffle is expected this week as Macron seeks to sharpen his team for the final three years of his presidency. 
“The president of the republic appointed Mr Gabriel Attal prime minister, and tasked him with forming a government,” a presidential statement said. 
Attal is set to bring a major change of style to the office of the prime minister following Borne, only the second woman to lead the French government.
Confirming the move on X, the president said he wanted the new premier to bring back the spirit of bold change from when Macron first won office on wave of hope for radical reform in 2017. 
‘Fragile as ever’ 
The appointment of Attal had been expected after Borne’s resignation on Monday, although the absence of a swift announcement fuelled talk that heavy-weight government figures were unhappy over the meteoric promotion of a man known sometimes by fellow ministers as “young Gabriel”. 
Sources close to those said to be behind the tensions, including Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, vehemently denied this.
Borne’s resignation letter to Macron, a copy of which was seen by AFP, hinted that she would have preferred to stay in her job. 
Commentators see the reshuffle as essential to relaunch Macron’s centrist presidency for its last three years and prevent him becoming a “lame duck” leader after a series of crises. 
Since he defeated the far right to win a second term in 2022, Macron has faced protests over unpopular pension reforms, the loss of his overall majority in parliamentary elections and controversy over immigration legislation. 
With Macron unable to run again in 2027 presidential elections, ministers have publicly aired concerns that Le Pen has her best chance to win the presidency.
Attal will go toe-to-toe ahead of the European elections with another rising star of French politics, the even younger Jordan Bardella, just 28, who is now party leader of the far-right RN. 
The conservative daily Le Figaro said Borne was leaving a political situation “that remains as fragile as ever. 
“Changing a face at the top doesn’t change the overall picture,” the newspaper said, adding Borne’s successor was facing “an overwhelming pile of political emergencies” including the task to unite a fragmented nation. 
‘Offensive strategy’ 
Under the French system, the president sets general policies and the prime minister is responsible for day-to-day government management, meaning the latter often pays the price when an administration runs into turbulence. 
Constitutional expert Benjamin Morel told AFP that Attal’s appointment signals a “very offensive strategy with a view to the European elections” in June. 
But political scientist Bruno Cautres said he would “not solve the problem of the majority, nor the main problem which is where the mandate (of Macron) is heading”. 
Other key posts are also subject to uncertainty, in particular that of Darmanin, 41, a right-winger said to covet the post of foreign minister held by Catherine Colonna.
The new head of government will be the fourth prime minister since 2017 under Macron, who is accused by critics of micro-managing and centralising power in the Elysee.

ISLAMABAD: In a significant move to bolster military cooperation, Pakistan, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia held discussions on potential collaboration in military technologies, according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.
The talks took place at the second meeting of the Trilateral Defence Industrial Collaboration, which was convened at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. This meeting follows the inaugural session of the committee held in Riyadh last August. The forum had been established to enhance cooperation in the field of defence among the three countries.
“The meeting provided an opportunity to discuss prospective collaboration in defence equipment technologies, including research and development,” the ISPR said.
The three countries emphasised the importance of pooling intellectual, technical, financial, and human resources to achieve shared objectives and attain self-sufficiency in the defence sector. They acknowledged their historical ties and reiterated their strategic intent to expand the scope of trilateral cooperation. The need to accelerate collaboration efforts in pursuit of common goals was also underscored.

Call for pooling resources to achieve shared objectives, attain self-sufficiency in defence sector

The three sides resolved to hold the next meeting on Trilateral Defence Industrial Collaboration during the World Defence Show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, scheduled for February 2024. This continued dialogue marks a significant step in strengthening defence ties and technological collaboration between Pakistan, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia.

On the sidelines of the trilateral dialogue, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia conducted their bilateral defence collaboration meeting, marking the third edition of the Pakistan-KSA Defence Collaboration Committee discussions, according to ISPR.
During the meeting, the participants engaged in detailed discussions on issues of bilateral interest and the evolving global security environment. The two sides focused their deliberations on the rapid advancements in military technologies and emphasised the necessity for defence industrial cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to fulfill shared objectives.
Both countries expressed a strong mutual desire to enhance defence cooperation across all domains, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in defence production. The forum also highlighted the importance of exploring further avenues for defence cooperation and accelerating the pace of their collaborative efforts.
This meeting underscores the growing defence relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and reflects their commitment to deepening bilateral ties in the defense sector, addressing modern challenges, and collaborating on technological advancements.

LONDON: An Indian delegation led by Minority Affairs Minister Smriti Irani visited Madina and other holy sites over the weekend as part of her two-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Indian media outlets have reported.
Ms Irani — who is also the women and child development minister — travelled to Madina along with Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan and other senior officials, according to The Indian Express.
The delegation also interacted with Indian volunteers “who provide dedicated and selfless service to Indian Haj pilgrims, including during Haj 2023” and Umrah pilgrims from India.
Ms Irani shared photos from her visit in a post shared on social media platform X on Monday, and said: “Undertook a historic journey to Medina today, one of Islam’s holiest cities included a visit to the periphery of the revered Prophet’s [peace be upon him] Mosque, Al Masjid Al Nabwi, the mountain of Uhud, and periphery of the Quba Mosque — the first Mosque of Islam.”

Rajnath in UK for talks on ‘military collaboration’

She added that the significance of the visit to these sites “intertwined with early Islamic history” and “underscores the depth of our cultural and spiritual engagement”.
She also attended the inauguration ceremony of the third Haj and Umrah Conference in Jeddah.
Until 2021, non-Muslims were not allowed to visit Madina, after which a relaxation of rules allowed them to visit the city centre up to the periphery of the Masjid-i-Nabwi.
The visit followed an agreement between India and Saudi Arabia, under which New Delhi was allocated a quota of 175,025 pilgrims for the annual Haj pilgrimage in 2024, The Indian Express reported.
Rajnath visits UK
Separately, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh began a two-day visit to the United Kingdom on Tuesday, with reports suggesting discussions on possible collaborations for military equipment between the two countries.
Mr Singh is the first Indian defence minister to have visited the UK in 22 years, and his trip is being viewed as a “significant improvement in bilateral ties” between the two countries.
Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, a senior fellow for South and Central Asian defence, strategy and diplomacy at London’s International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said the visit is significant despite differences between India and the UK on the Russia-Ukraine war.
“...defence technological and industrial partnerships, a key objective of India’s efforts to boost self-reliance in arms production, remains challenging with the reluctance of the UK defence industry to engage boldly with India, unlike their counterparts in the US and France,” Mr Roy-Chaudhury wrote in an analysis for Indian publication The Wire. 
He added that Mr Singh’s visit “could prove pivotal by progressing significant collaborative projects at a political level”. 
This could include the co-development of gas-turbine propulsion technology by Rolls-Royce and India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation for the next generation of Indian fighter aircraft engines.
He noted that the UK government supports India’s plans to develop its defence industry, but “in practice, no significant India-UK collaboration regarding defence capabilities has occurred as yet”.
“Additional challenges could include the emergence of firm evidence on allegations of official Indian involvement in targeted assassinations/assassination attempts in the US and Canada, as well as a rise in Sikh separatist (Khalistani) extremism in the UK,” the scholar added.

Donald Trump

WASHINGTON: A Washington appeals court questioned Donald Tru­mp’s claims that he is immune from criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election, as the former US president on Tuesday warned he could prosecute Joe Biden if he returns to the White House.
Trump looked on as his legal team sought to convince a panel of three judges that former presidents should not be prosecuted for actions they took in office. Trump is due to go to trial in March on federal charges of election subversion.
Judges reacted sceptically to that argument.
“You’re saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could tell SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival?” Judge Florence Pan asked Trump’s lawyer D. John Sauer.

Ex-president warns he could prosecute Biden if returns to White House

Sauer said that a former president could be charged for such conduct only if they were first impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted in the Senate.
 
 

Trump did not address the court, or speak to news media that waited outside the courthouse. He did, however, confer quietly with his attorneys several times during the hearing.
With the Republican state-by-state presidential nominating contest due to kick off next week, Trump used the hearing as an opportunity to claim he is the victim of political persecution.
In a video posted to social media ahead of the hearing, Trump said he could prosecute Democ­ratic President Joe Biden if he wins the November presidential election.
“If I don’t get immunity then crooked Joe Biden doesn’t get immunity,” Trump said. “Joe would be ripe for indictment.”
Trump, who lost to Biden in the 2020 election, has opened up a commanding lead over his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination since the first criminal charge against him was announced last March. He is expected to easily win Monday’s contest in Iowa.
Pandora’s box
The US Justice Department has long held that presidents cannot be prosecuted while in office for doing their official duties. Trump, the first former U.S. president to be criminally prosecuted, faces 91 criminal counts in four separate cases.
 
 

Sauer, Trump’s lawyer, told a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that allowing prosecution to go forward would lead to a cycle of retribution after each election and “open a Pandora’s Box from which that nation may never recover.”
He said presidents must first be impeached and removed from office by Congress before he could be prosecuted. Trump was impeached twice but the Senate failed to convict him.
‘Not above the law’
The case against Trump reflects the unprecedented nature of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and granting him immunity for those actions would give future presidents license to commit crimes, Justice Department lawyer James Pearce told the panel.
“The president has a unique constitutional role, but he is not above the law,” he said.
Both the legal outcome and timing of the appeals court’s ruling will play a pivotal role in determining whether Trump faces trial ahead of the Nov 5, 2024, election.

• Appeals against Shehbaz, Nawaz rejected in Lahore, Abbottabad
• Verdict reserved on Imran’s appeal for NA-122 seat         
RAWALPINDI/LAHORE: In a series of rulings by various election appellate tribunals across the country, several politicians faced rejections regarding their eligibility to contest in the upcoming general elections, including former federal ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Murad Saeed.
On the other hand, tribunals in Lahore and Abbottabad set aside objections to the acceptance of nomination papers of the Sharif brothers in NA-132 and NA-15 constituencies.
The election tribunal in Rawalpindi, hearing Mr Chaudhry’s case, rejected his nomination papers on the charge of concealing facts from the returning officer.
The tribunal judge, Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz of the Lahore High Court, was hearing 
Mr Chaudhry’s appeal against the rejection of his nomination papers to contest the upcoming elections from Jhelum’s NA-60 and NA-61 constituencies.
The former PTI leader was accused of concealing bank accounts of his spouse and foreign trips in the affidavit submitted along with his nomination papers.
Verdict reserved on Imran’s appeal
Meanwhile, another appellate tribunal in Lahore reserved its verdict on Tuesday on an appeal of former prime minister Imran Khan, who had challenged the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-122.
Mr Khan’s counsel, Advocate Uzair Bhandari, said in his concluding arguments that the conviction of the PTI founding chairman in the Toshakhana case was not a hurdle in his way of contesting the upcoming general elections.
He said the Election Commission of Pakistan was not a court and its conviction in the Toshakhana case did not amount to disqualification under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.
Besides, the former premier’s sentence had already been suspended by the Islamabad High Court, the lawyer said.
Tribunal judge Justice Tariq Nadeem observed that there was a difference between the acquittal and suspension of sentence.
Appeal against Shehbaz rejected
On Tuesday, another election tribunal dismissed an appeal against the acceptance of nomination papers of former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif from NA-132.
The appellant, Shahid Orakzai, assailed the candidature of Mr Shehbaz on the basis of his alleged involvement in the 1997 attack on the Supreme Court.
He submitted that the Islamabad police, in its inquiry submitted to the Supreme Court, had identified then-chief minister Shehbaz and then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif as two top powerful people involved in the attack.
Mr Orakzai said the tribunal was empowered to verify the facts from the inquiry report in possession of the Supreme Court’s registrar.
He asked the tribunal to set aside the decision of the returning officer and reject Shehbaz Sharif’s nomination papers from NA-132. However, the tribunal dismissed the appeal and upheld the RO’s decision.
Another tribunal also dismissed an appeal against the acceptance of PML-N leader Abid Sher Ali’s nomination papers from NA-102, Faisalabad.
Another tribunal on Tuesday reserved verdict on appeals by PTI President Parvez Elahi, his wife, Qaisera Elahi, and son, Moonis Elahi, against the rejection of their nomination papers from NA-64, NA-69, PP-32 and PP-34 of Gujrat.
Another tribunal set aside a decision of the returning officer of NA-71, Sialkot, and accepted the nomination papers of Rehana Dar, mother of PTI’s former leader Usman Dar.
PTI objections on Nawaz set aside
In Abbottabad, an election appellate tribunal on Tuesday set aside PTI’s objections raised on PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s eligibility to contest the Feb 8 elections from NA-15.
PTI leader Senator Azam Khan Swati had last month challenged Nawaz’s eligibility to contest the upcoming general elections from the constituency — also called Mansehra-II — under section 62(1f) of the Constitution.
The tribunal judge, Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel, cleared the PML-N supreme leader for elections after hearing arguments of Senator Swati’s counsel, Sardar Basharat, and Nawaz Sharif’s counsel, Jehangir Jadoon.
Similarly, an appellate tribunal in Hazara on Monday dismissed the objection against the acceptance of the nomination papers of former provincial minister and PTI leader Yousuf Ayub Khan.
Yousuf Ayub Khan, the first cousin of PTI’s general secretary Omar Ayub Khan, was contesting from Haripur’s NA-18 and PK-46 seats.
Murad Saeed’s appeals rejected
In Swat, an appellate tribunal in Mingora on Tuesday dismissed both the appeals of the PTI leader Murad Saeed and issued an order to uphold the decision of the returning officers.
The returning officers had rejected Mr Saeed’s nomination papers for NA-3 and NA-4 as he was on the absconders’ list.
On Monday, the tribunal judge, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar, told Mr Saeed’s lawyers to ask the PTI leader to appear in person, but he failed to appear on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the election tribunal approved the nomination papers of PTI’s former provincial minister, Shakeel Ahmed, from Malakand and allowed him to contest the elections.

ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Cou­rt on Wednesday rejected a request to stay Jan 11 Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) proceedings against Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, as an SJC member Justice Ijazul Ahsan described the council’s proceedings against his colleague “contrary to the established norms”.
A three-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mando­khail and Justice Musarrat Hilali asked the petitioner judge to amend his petitions by incorporating the complainants before the SJC as respondents.
When senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan repeatedly requested the bench to at least stay the SJC proceedings, as was done in the cases of Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Khan observed that the present proceedings were preliminary in nature.
The three-judge bench had taken up a set of petitions challenging the issuance of a show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi, who was facing complaints of misconduct before the SJC. The SJC, which is seized with a set of 10 different complaints against the judge, will resume its proceedings in the open court on Jan 11 (Thursday).
The court was hearing arguments for the last two days on a point that should the court allow the informer, who filed complaints before the SJC, to become a necessary party in the pe­­­titions, moved by the judge. “It is ne­­cessary to hear the other side so that nobody should be left unheard and that justice should also be seen to be done,” Justice Mandokhail observed. 

Justice Ahsan describes proceedings against SC judge as ‘contrary to established norms’

Justice Mandokhail observed that the complaints before the SJC should be comprehensive so that no judge against whom the complaint had been filed could go scot-free. He added that the complainants should be punished in case allegations turned out to be baseless.
Makhdoom Ali Khan, however, ar­­gued that the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) has no right to punish anybody since proceedings under this provision were not adversarial.
He argued the informers have no right to expect their complaints shou­­ld always be inquired upon by SJC and if every complainant has to be he­­a­rd then this tendency would expose the judges and the judiciary since whenever denied the right or in case of any adverse order by the cou­rt, the aggrieved complainant will knock the doors of the Supreme Court.
The counsel also cited the recent meeting of SJC in which it decided to reject 19 different complaints against different judges without hearing the complaints.
Citing the cases of Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, the counsel contended that the courts had held while deciding these matters that Article 209 under which proceedings against the judges were initiated on misconduct, was more concerned with the protection of judges than prosecuting them.
In his petition, Justice Naqvi had described the allegations levelled in the show-cause notice as false, baseless and not supported by evidence.
‘Hasty’ proceedings
On the other hand, Justice Ijazul Ahsan — part of the five-member council — who had refused to join other members of the council on Nov 22, 2023, in the issuance of the show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi, regretted the hasty proceedings.
In his letter to the SJC members, Justice Ahsan regretted that debate and discussion have been non-existent and have not been permitted during the ongoing council proceedings. “Thus Nov 22, 2023 proceedings when the second show-cause notice was issued against Justice Naqvi were completely devoid of any discussion or deliberation whatsoever,” he said.
This manner of proceedings has cast an unwelcome doubt over the whole process, therefore he disagreed with the process followed and the manner in which the proceedings were being conducted, Justice Ahsan explained.
Referring to the allegations in the complaint against the judge, the letter regretted these were utterly without merit or substance, both in law and even on a prima facie appraisal of the facts.
“Of these, allegations a few relate to the properties or transactions of properties of the sons of the respondent ju­­d­­­ge when the sons were lawyers in pr­­a­­ctice and persons of independent me­­ans.” The sons are effectively being condemned unheard, the letter regretted.
The thrust of the allegations is that the properties have been transacted at values supposedly far below their market value but not a shred of any credible evidence has been produced by the complainants in this regard.
“If the judge had been given an opportunity as suggested and the properties mentioned found to be declared in his tax returns, the matter of whether there had been any undervaluation as alleged would then be for the tax authorities to determine under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001,” the letter said.
The letter regretted that a reasoned and deliberative approach ought to have been adopted which would have prevented the council from falling into the error that has now been committed with the issuance of the show-cause notice.

GILGIT: Protests aga­inst the increase in subsidised wheat rates entered their 14th day on Tuesday, with scores of people blocking main roads in the region despite freezing temperatures.
Meanwhile, opposition members in the GB Assembly have submitted a requisition for a session to discuss the region’s financial and wheat crises.
The Awami Action Committee, an alliance of various political and religious parties in the region, gave the call for protests against the decision to increase the subsidised wheat rate from Rs20 to Rs36 per kilogram and other issues.
Demonstrations were recorded in all ten districts of GB, with protesters vowing to continue sit-ins till the acceptance of their demands.
In the Khomar area of Gilgit, local women bloc­ked Shahrah-i-Quaid-i-Azam to protest against flour sho­­rtage.
They accused the food department of decr­e­asing the subsidised wheat quota for households.
One protester alleged that only 20kg of flour was being provided per family, which was not enough for even a month.
She said it was a “double injustice” to cut the flour quota and increase the subsidised wheat rate.
A demonstration was also organised in the Jutial area of Gilgit, with protesters blocking a road and chanting slogans against the government.
GB assembly session
In the GB Assembly, Opposition Leader Kazim Mesum and other members submitted a requisition for convening a session to discuss the financial crisis and subsidised wheat rate hike.
The requisition, signed by 10 opposition parties’ members, requested the GB Assembly speaker to con­­vene the session on Jan 11.

ISLAMABAD:  Around a dozen PTI workers held a protest in the federal capital on  Tuesday against what they called “the sale of party’s tickets” in Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa.
The workers, who reached Islamabad from KP, held a protest outside PTI’s office in G8, claiming that the party has been “hijacked by some elements close to the establishment, former chief minister Pervaiz Khattak and Aleem Khan”.
While speaking to the media, Saud Shah Roghani, who submitted his nomination papers from the PK-55 constituency of KP Assembly, said the party has been “hijacked by leaders close to the establishment”.
He also announced plans to launch his own panel for the upcoming elections, claiming it would be  “the true representative of Imran Khan”.
“Imran Khan said ‘absolutely not’ to the US. Now a decision has been made to punish him for that statement, and his friends are being used to weaken him and his party so he would be left with no choice but to surrender,” Mr Roghani claimed.
Mr Roghani reiterated “his support for Mr Khan for change” and vowed to continue supporting his leader.
He claimed to be “representing 500 candidates from across the country” and said he would distribute tickets among them.
He also threatened to launch his own panel for the general elections and give tickets to party loyalists.
“Currently,  a four-member committee has been established for the distribution of tickets [in KP], and tickets are being sold,” he alleged, citing Rs40 million as the price for one ticket.
 
 

Mr Roghani called PTI’s intra-party elections “flawed”, adding that PTI KP and other office bearers elected after the exercise “had no value”.
Those leaders who  had been “watching their own interests for the last 10 years” have been  “selected” as a result of the flawed elections.
He claimed the establishment was arresting party workers and trying to fill PTI’s ranks with their loyalists.
“Establishment has been trying to weaken the party. Currently, tickets are being given on the directions of Aleem Khan and Pervaiz Khattak,” alleged Mr  Roghani.
“Imran Khan always stood for merit, but at the moment,  tickets are being given only to corrupt people. Imran Khan is in jail  and does not know what is happening with the party.”
He added that even though he submitted nomination papers for the national and provincial assembly, he will withdraw them.
Mr  Roghani said that in the absence of intra-party elections, he had an equal  status in the party as the incumbent chairman, Barrister Gohar.

ISLAMABAD: While mercury has fallen across the country, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has issued a travel advisory for the prevention of influenza and other respiratory infections.
The advisory also talks about influenza-like illness (ILI) and respiratory syncytial virus which are caused by influenza.
“Flu viruses are continuously changing/mutating with a likelihood of emergence of new flu viruses every year. This makes influenza a difficult disease to control with varying extent of spread, timing, severity, and length of the season. However, an upsurge of cases in Pakistan is usually been observed in winter season. The flu cases increase as temperature falls during December to February,” it stated.
“The ILI cases are observed to be higher in Islamabad specifically due to various reasons ranging from weather instability (dry cold) which causes low precipitation and increased tourism to northern and from northern areas via Islamabad despite satisfactory surveillance of influenza,” it stated.
The objective of the advisory is to alert and sensitise all travellers regarding the ILI situation in country, especially Islamabad.
Also, to alert and sensitise points of entry and healthcare workers to be vigilant in the detection of any suspected case who is travelling to and from any area where the ILI cases have been reported and to strengthen and improve the level of preparedness for prevention, control and management of influenza-like illness.
Influenza is easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing and its symptoms include the abrupt onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue.

• BSF speakers seek judicial probe into killings by banned outfits in Balochistan
• Dr Mahrang set to call for another nationwide strike
ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Press Club (NPC) remains a focal point for the ongoing protests for the rights of Balochistan, with two separate camps witnessing a steady influx of visitors.
However, while the cro­wd at one of the camps, or­­ganised by the Baloch­is­tan Shuhada Forum (BSF), has decreased, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) camp sees a growing number of families joining in.
 
 

Abdullah Gul, the cha­i­r­man of Tehreek-i-Jawa­n­­an Pakistan/Kashmir, visited the BSF camp on Tu­­esday, led by former caretaker minister Nawabzada Jamal Raisani.
During his visit, Mr Gul highlighted the involvement of India’s foreign intelligence agency RAW in terror activities in Balochistan.
Mr Raisani, also conte­sting for a National Ass­e­m­­bly seat from Quetta, em­­phasised the need for the government to ackno­wledge and financially support victims of terrorism and targeted killings in Balochistan.
The government nee­d­­ed to listen to the voice of the martyrs of Baloch­is­tan, both the civilians and those belonging to law enforcement agencies and armed forces, he said and hinted at a conspiracy to create internal conflicts within Balochistan.
“The state should at le­­ast extend financial help to the victims of terrorism and target killings,” Mr Raisani told Dawn. “The missing person issue was a genuine problem of Bal­o­­­chistan, but we demand that they should condemn the terror acts by Balo­ch­istan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Libe­ration Force (BLF), Balo­­ch Republican Army (BRA), Majeed Brigade, etc.”
 
 

Mr Raisani’s father, Nawabzada Siraj Raisani, was assassinated in a 2018 suicide attack during the election campaign.
At the same time, speakers at the BSF camp called for a judicial commission to investigate the killings by banned outfits. They accused the rival BYC camp of being fraudulent and supporting anti-state elements.
The names of Baloch Na­­­­tional Army (BNA) com­­manders Gulzar Imam Shambe and Sarf­raz Ahmed Bungulzai, who earlier admitted to receiving funding from India, were also mentioned in the speeches.
BYC camp
On the other hand, the BYC camp, which has been established since Dec 22, continued to attract more participants despite harsh weather and pressure from law enforcement agencies.
 






The camp’s organisers, demanding information on missing persons, welcomed 12 new family members, mostly women, on Monday and Tuesday.
Dr Mahrang Baloch, a leader of BYC, told the media that her camp welcomed the BSF protesters and said they, too, were demanding the authorities to act and improve the law and order situation in Balochistan.
“This is what we have been demanding that the law and the system of the country should prevail in Balochistan, too,” she said.
“There has only been one accusation on us that we do not condemn violence by BLA. We have done it several times and say it here as well.”
 






Referring to the BSF camp, she said that those referring to the surrender of some people should understand that any news conference was not enough, and the surrendering people should have to be presented in a court of law.
Dr Mahrang, possibly encouraged by the response to previous strike calls, said the BYC would soon announce plans for a nationwide strike to demand transparency regarding the details of missing persons.

GWADAR: Protests continued in Turbat, Panjgur and other towns of Makran against the alleged enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings of political workers and students. The demonstrators also called out the violence against the participants of Turbat long march in Islamabad.
The Panjgur protest rally was called by Baloch Yak­jehti Committee (BYC). The protesters included a good number of political workers, students, women and children.
 






The demonstrators gathered at Javed Shaheed Chowk and then marched on various roads of the town, chanting slogans against the government. They were also holding placards and banners inscribed with their demands.
The leaders of BYC, including Nazeer Dost, Adiba Baloch, the daughter of missing Zaheer Baloch, Bisma Baloch, Fahid Asif Baloch and Nadir Baloch, while speaking at the gathering, said the government was itself violating the relative article of the Constitution regarding human rights.
“The tactics used by the government can not suppress the voice of Baloch people since not only they’re struggling for their rights, but also saving the lives of their missing loved ones,” the speakers said.

ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission Pakistan (ECP) has sent a list of electoral symbols of 145 political parties to the returning officers (ROs).
Sources told Dawn the list does not include ‘bat’ — PTI’s electoral symbol. Around a dozen other parties, including ANP, have also not been allotted symbols due to legal deficiencies.
 
 

PTI has been deprived of the symbol as ECP has declared its intra-party elections null and void, while the ANP failed to conduct the elections and thus became ineligible to obtain election symbols under the law.
Major parties, which have been allotted symbols, include PPPP (arrow), PML-N (tiger), PTI-Nazriyati (batsman), PTI-Parliamentarians (turban), Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (eagle),  MQM-P (kite), JUI-F (book), BNP-Mengal (axe), Jamaat-i-Islami (scale), Sunni Ittehad Council (horse), BAP (human eye), Pakistan Muslim League (tractor) and PkMAP Party (tree).
The list of contesting candidates will be published tomorrow (January 11), and returning officers are to allot symbols to the contesting candidates on Jan 13.
It has been highlighted that election symbols of political parties shall in no case be allotted to any independent candidate. The list of separate election symbols for independent candidates has also been sent to the ROs.
The Election Commission has directed the returning officers not to allot symbols other than those mentioned in the list.

ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Tuesday sanctioned Rs250 million in additional funds for the Intelligence Bureau and approved a mechanism for basket price for imported and local urea that would make costlier the key agricultural ingredient by Rs160-170 per bag.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar also approved about Rs3.67 billion in grants for the Federal Directorate of Immunisation and Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF). “The ECC approved the mechanism for weighted average price with the direction to National Fertiliser Marketing Ltd (NFML) for ensuring reasonable price for urea and Ministry of Industries & Production to provide oversight to the whole process”, said an official statement.
The Ministry of Industries, NFML and local urea manufacturers would now work out the final sale price based on the mix of local production and imported fertiliser including other expenses. Therefore, the minimum retail price (MRP) that currently ranges between Rs3,600 to Rs3,980 per 50kg bag would go up by Rs160 to Rs170 to Rs3,770 to Rs4,100 per bag.
A senior industries ministry official told Dawn that the meeting appreciated the ‘reasonable price’ secured from Azerbaijan’s Socar Trading for 220,000 tonnes of urea on a G2G basis. He said the meeting was told that previous ECC and cabinet meetings had decided on multiple occasions over the past two months that the subsidy on imported urea would be borne by the provinces.

Growers to pay Rs170 more for 50-kg urea bag

The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) reported the total subsidy cost at about Rs27.5bn and the landed cost of imported urea at about Rs6,250 per bag of 50kg. On top of this would be incidental charges of about Rs4.9bn, according to NFML, thus taking the total subsidy requirement to Rs30.4bn.
However, the Punjab government has contended that it would bear only 50pc cost while Sindh agreed to pay the full cost of subsidy for 53,000 tonnes of urea (24pc of 220,000 tonnes) but Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa did not respond.
The ECC also approved a request of the Intelligence Bureau for the provision of Rs250m in additional funds during 2023-24. The bureau briefed the committee about the recent surge in terrorism activities which needed effective countermeasures to thwart nefarious designs of terrorists. 
The ECC also approved a request of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination for the release of Rs100m for the participation of the national hockey team in international events and other sports promotion activities. This grant, ECC was told would also be utilised for Davis Cup (Tennis) with India and other mind games like Scrabble and Chess.

KARACHI: Ambassa­dor of the European Union Raina Kionka has said that the GSP+ status for Pakistan has been rolled over without any changes to the rules of framework so everything was going to stay the same up to 2027.
“We also have elections in June 2024, which means there will be a political changeover in the parliament and the EU’s Commission. Once everything settles, we expect that the new parliament and the Council of EU member states will once again take up negotiations on a new directive for GSP+ with Pakistan which couldn’t happen last year,” she said while addr­essing the members of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Tuesday.
Although it’s a four-year rollover for GSP+, if they come up with a new regulation, it will become effective before 2027, she added.
According to KCCI’s press release, the EU ambassador said that rather than staying confined to exporting textiles only, the business community of Karachi should broaden and diversify their exports to the EU to take maximum advantage of GSP+.
“GSP+ is tremendously important for Pakistan’s economy whose overwhelming beneficiaries are not just textile producers but also workers in textile factories,” she said, adding that GSP+ has been extremely positive and useful in economic terms during the last 10 years as it helped in increasing Pakistan’s exports to EU by 108pc while EU imports also ascended by 40pc since the start of this scheme.
While identifying gems and jewellery, tourism, handcrafts and auto parts as potential sectors under GSP+, she said that the EU’s delegation in Islamabad would also like to set up a platform to promote EU-Pakistan business-to-business relations which could also help the SMEs in making good connections with businesses in EU and ultimately help the SMEs in Pakistan to also benefit from GSP+.
Earlier, KCCI President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh said that the EU has been the largest export destination for Pakistan, which stood at $8.4 billion, followed by the US at $5.93bn and China at $2.02bn in FY23.
Pakistan’s exports to the EU are dominated by the textiles sector and last year, Pakistan’s total textile exports remained at $16.50bn which is almost 60pc of the total exports.
He said Pakistan and the EU need to discuss ways to improve Pakistani products’ access to the EU market, address trade barriers, foster collaboration, focus on export diversification, and ensure smoother trade practices and compliance with international standards.

KARACHI: Caretaker Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz has reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to making Pakistani markets accessible to the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region aimed at tapping the potential for collaboration in agriculture, textiles, engineering, and services.
“This commitment aligns seamlessly with the Look Africa Policy, emphasising Pakistan’s objective to unlock its economic and trade potential, Mr Gohar said while engaging in discussions with Egypt’s Commerce Minister Ahmed Samir who was also the chief guest of the 4th Pakistan-Africa Trade Development Conference (PATDC) and Single Country Exhibition (SCE) in Cairo on Tuesday.
The focus is on facilitating investments and making markets more accessible, contributing to the broader goals of economic growth and cooperation, he added.
He said the 4th PATDC and SCE not only serve as a platform for bilateral discussions but also as a catalyst for the exchange of ideas and strategies to en­hance economic ties. “The event sets the stage for further collaboration, paving the way for increa­sed cooperation and mutual prosperity, Mr Gohar remarked.
Both parties recognised the mutual benefits that can arise from expanding economic and trade ties. The meeting, held in the presence of policymakers and business leaders from various countries, facilitated a convergence of diverse ideas and opinions, creating an enriching environment for meaningful discussions.
The discussions underscored the commitment of both nations to deepening economic cooperation and leveraging each other’s strengths in key sectors.
According to the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), this is the first time Pakistan is bringing 100-plus companies to Egypt to enhance trade and economic cooperation and open new horizons between Egypt and Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: Bureau­cratic hurdles are leading to unnecessary delays in supply of electricity to industrial units in the country’s first Special Eco­nomic Zone (SEZ) at Rashakai, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa.
It is a key component of the China-Pakistan Eco­nomic Corridor (CPEC).
The first phase of SEZ, which comprises 247 acres under the CPEC, was completed six months ago and plots were assigned to 18 industrial units.
Seven of these units have nearly finalised their setups and are poised to commence operations, according to official documents.
Most of the units set up in the SEZ are export-oriented, with a few focused on import substitution. The delay in electricity supply is a growing concern for these industrial units, potentially impacting their operations and overall negative signals to prospective investors.
Investors, among them overseas Pakistanis and one Chinese, are trying hard to secure electricity and gas connections, but caretaker ministers appear to be preoccupied with foreign visits and election-focused projects.
The Rashakai SEZ is the second in KP officially approved by the federal Board of Investment (BOI) under the SEZ Act of 2012. Under this law, the federal and provincial governments are bound to supply gas, electricity, and other utilities to the designated zero point of an SEZ.
The transmission lines for electricity designed to supply 160 MW have already been extended to the zero point of the SEZ. Additionally, a 132 KV grid station at Rashakai has been completed. Development work inside the SEZ has also been completed.
The China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), a co-developer of the SEZ, applied to the power regulator (Nepra) for a licence six months ago. This licence would allow CRBC to supply electricity to industrial units within the SEZ.
The application was submitted through a special purpose vehicle company_ Rashakai Special Economic Zone Develop­ment and Management Company (RSEZDOC).
The licence is needed to supply and purchase power from the Peshawar Electricity Supply Com­pany (Pesco) .
The prevailing tariff for single-point supply (over 132KV) from Pesco falls under the C-3 (commercial category), which is higher than industrial category tariffs ranging from B-1 to B-4.
Red tape
Federal bureaucrats have shown reluctance in offering industrial tariffs to industries within Rashakai SEZ, despite the availability of B-4 industrial tariffs to units in Lahore’s Sundar Industrial Estate.
“We believe that the high tariff will not only discourage investment but will also affect the Chinese enterprises’ relocation to Rashakai SEZ”, the provincial caretaker Minister for Industries and Commerce, Aamer Abdullah, told Dawn on Tuesday.
Mr Abdullah said he had raised the matter with the Nepra chief. “Later I approached Care­taker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, who instructed the federal minister for energy and power to hold a meeting with us,” he said. This led to a meeting between the KP team and the federal ministry.
“I have been pursuing this matter since assuming my ministerial role four months ago,” he added, expressing disappointment over the lack of progress thus far.
Official documents indicate that enterprises at the Rashakai SEZ will be charged a higher rate of electricity compared to other industries in the country. This could potentially discourage investment and hinder the achievement of industrial cooperation objectives between China and Pakistan.
The success of any SEZ, including Rashakai, is not solely dependent on the provision of electricity, but rather on the availability of affordable and stable electricity.

ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Minister for IT and Telecom Dr Umar Saif on Tuesday launched the first-ever Pakistan Start-up Fund (PSF) worth Rs2 billion to attract venture investments and position local start-ups as significant players on the global stage.
Ignite National Technology Fund will take charge as the executing body of the PSF and ensure transparency through an independent steering body overseeing the operations.
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Dr Umar Saif said that the government will allocate up to Rs2bn for PSF every year, and the fund is structured as equity-free capital to help close a venture capital round for a start-up.
The PSF was designed to help a startup raise its first external investment.
The minister said that $800 million has been invested in Pakistani start-ups in the last four years.
Under the system, the PSF will give 30pc grant for the investments of the total requirement for the start-up.
“The PSF is designed to lower the risk for international investors to invest in Pakistani start-ups, we hope to create a value of at least Rs50 billion per year in the start-up ecosystem in Pakistan”, the caretaker minister said.
He added that the fund represents a transformative initiative in the realm of entrepreneurship and technological innovation.
“Pakistan Start-up Fund will accelerate economic growth and innovation in the country, and it will underwrite the risk of Venture capitalists by providing equity-free grants to start-ups as the last cheque in an investment round,” the caretaker minister said.
He added that the fund will connect innovative start-ups, venture capitalists and investors, while the IT ministry will be supporting technological innovation and entrepreneurship.
The country has over 4,000 active startups supported by eight National Innovation Centres.

ISLAMABAD: With the novel application of high-level technology combining satellite remote sensing and mathematical modelling supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), water and land management will be improved for more than 750,000 hectares of agricultural land in Punjab.
The Water-Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF)-supported approach has enabled the application of the new technology which has been used elsewhere to inform farmers of irrigation requirements at the farm scale. WFPF is pivotal in enhancing ADB’s operations and responding to the Asia-Pacific region’s challenges by delivering ‘business-as-usual’.
An ADB report highlights that utilising high-level remote sensing technology and mathematical programming techniques for canal management in Punjab will benefit approximately 2 million people. 
This intervention enhances resilience to climate changes and improves social equity through rotation corrections, leading to increased food production, farm profitability, and reduced income disparity. The approach offers a cost-effective alternative to infrastructure rehabilitation, showcasing potential for expansion and replication in future irrigation modernisation projects.
The Pakistan activity has brought together farmers, government agencies, leading universities, researchers, canal operators, and consultants to develop innovative technology. It installed sensors and has developed the decision support system to establish a responsive distributary rotation that promotes equity in access to water among farming families to increase their climate resilience.

The legal segregation proposed by the financial advisers for divestment is aimed at the separation of core aviation business and assets for the eventual divestment of core aviation services in the first stance.
The non-core assets will be retained in a holdco structure for subsequent divestment in separate structures and transactions.

KARACHI: The stock market on Tuesday continued witnessing depressed trading on persisting political uncertainty amid calls from the US and UK ambassadors for fair polls as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed the session on a negative note.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation told Dawn that the growing politi­cal uncertainty reg­ar­ding the holding of general elections on Feb 8 and the downturn in global markets were the key factors that fuelled gloomy conditions on the PSX.
He added that the equity market outlook would remain uncertain till the date of the poll because the Western countries stressed inclusive elections and the IMF talks would be impacted by it.

LAHORE: The Punjab Board Committee chairman has announced a significant change in the examination system for the ninth and 10th grades.
The move, aimed at streamlining the examination process, involves reducing one paper from the current format.
Traditionally, students in the ninth and 10th grades had to sit for separate papers for Islamic Studies and Pakistan Studies. However, under the new system, there will be a single paper of 100 marks for Islamic Studies in the ninth grade, and a single paper of 100 marks for Pakistan Studies in the 10th class.
The decision is set to be implemented from the ninth grade in 2025.
The Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) controller of examinations has already communicated the change to the Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board (PCTB). As a result, from next year onwards, the textbooks for Pakistan Studies and Islamic Studies will be revised and prepared in accordance with the new decision.
This move is expected to simplify the examination process and reduce the burden on students, thereby fostering a more conducive learning environment. It remains to be seen how this change will be received by students and educators alike.
According to a notification available with Dawn, the papers in the subjects of Islamiat (compulsory) and Pakistan Studies (compulsory) are conducted at secondary school certificate (SSC) level. The examination of these subjects carrying 100 marks each is conducted in two parts i.e. ninth and 10th and each part carries 50 marks.
It is pertinent to mention here that on the instructions received from the Punjab government, a subject of Tarjmatul Quranul Majeed has also been added to the scheme of studies and the paper of this subject was also taken by the board in SSC (ninth & 10th) first & second annual examinations, 2023. Now, a student has to attempt nine subjects in one part.
A proposal with regard to conducting the paper of Islamiat (compulsory) and Pakistan Studies (compulsory) in SSC level separately for 100 marks in each part instead of both parts of SSC exam was deliberated by the Punjab Boards Committee of Chairperson (PBCC) which was approved and decided as below: The proposed intervention was deliberated upon and approved the same as it would reduce the cumulative number of papers from nine to eight (part-I & part-II each) for the candidates of SSC examination.
The PBCC further decided that the matter may be taken up with Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board to revise the scheme accordingly and launch books of Islamiat and Pakistan Studies with model paper of 100 marks (for both subjects) for SSC part-I and part-II, respectively. For the session of 2024-2026, the paper will be administered for 100 marks for Islamiat in SSC part-I in 2025 and 100 marks for Pakistan Studies in SSC part-II in 2026.
The PCTB has been requested to initiate work for publishing and releasing a book of Islamiat (compulsory) with a model paper of 100 marks for SSC (ninth) students for 2024 and a book of Pakistan Studies with a model paper of 100 marks for students of SSC (10th) for 2025.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday disposed of a petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for imposing a ban on conducting surveys and public polls by the electronic media in particular before the upcoming general elections.  
A counsel for the ECP told the court that the ban was related to the polling day only. He assured the court that the media can run public surveys and programmes about the elections.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi disposed of the petition in light of the statement of the ECP.
Journalist Muneer Ahmad Bajwa filed the petition challenging clause 12 of the code of conduct issued by the ECP for the electronic media and a subsequent notification by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) putting a ban on pre-election surveys and polls.
The petitioner through counsel Mian Dawood argued that the ECP for the first time introduced the impugned clause in its code of conduct for media issued under section 233 of the Election Act of 2017. He said the Pemra announced an action against the television channels for airing survey-based programmes in the electoral constituencies. He argued that the ECP imposed the impugned ban on the electronic, print, and digital media against the Constitution.
The counsel argued that clause 12 of the ECP code of conduct was contradictory to the fundamental rights of the citizens protected under articles 4, 19, and 19A of the Constitution.

LAHORE: Three police officials allegedly involved in harassing and extorting an amount of Rs50,000 from ‘an elite family’ outside a Gulberg restaurant have been arrested and sent behind bars after registration of a case over ‘extortion charges’.
The policemen took the family forcibly to a bank branch, accusing them of ‘involvement in immoral activities’ and got the money withdrawn through the ATM.
There were reports that the suspected police officials had been targeting couples outside the restaurants in Gulberg. The modus operandi was that they used to make video recordings of the couples sitting in cars and deprive them of their money and other belongings over the allegations of committing immoral activities.
Reports suggested that they used to take the ‘preys’ to the banks and withdraw money through ATM cards, hurling threats that they would upload the video on the social media or take them to the police station to lodge a criminal case against them.
An official privy to the information told Dawn that the matter came to the limelight as they had repeated the crime while targeting an elite family which was close to a high-ranked officer of a security institute.
The senior officer of the law-enforcement agency expressed his utter displeasure when the matter was reported to him by the victim family.
The official said he immediately called IGP Dr Usman Anwar and asked him to take notice of the incident. He said the police high-ups dispatched various teams to trace and arrest the policemen within hours.
The Gulberg police later arrested the cops who were identified as Umar Akram, Abbas and Irshad belonging to the operations wing of the Lahore police.
According to the FIR, the suspected police officials approached the car parked alongside Hali Road. They asked the family to come out of the vehicle and on questioning they accused them of committing immoral activities.
It further stated that the man, who was occupying the driving seat, told the police officials that the woman sitting in the car hailed from his family. On this, the policemen abused the man and threatened to take him to the police station to lodge a case of ‘involvement in immoral activities’, according to the FIR.
Meanwhile, one of the policemen demanded money from the man to avoid a criminal case. When he told the officials that he had no cash, they forcibly took him to a nearby bank at Main Boulevard, Gulberg, and got Rs50,000 drawn through his ATM card, reads the FIR. The official source said it was the second such incident.
Earlier, a racket of the officials from the Gulberg and Ghalib Market police stations had been detected some years back.
He said the policemen had recorded video films of several couples outside the restaurants and blackmailed them for money.
At that time the police high-ups had recovered several explicit video clips of the couples and families from the mobile phones of the policemen.
However, the matter was restricted to minor departmental punishments only as the police high-ups had feared that it might cause embarrassment for the department.

LAHORE: In a bid to control smog, pollution and other environment and traffic-related issues, the construction work at the six traffic choke points in the provincial capital has been launched. 
The work has been launched by the Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning Agency (Tepa) in the light of surveys amid traffic impact assessments etc to make all six choke points trouble-free on the directions of Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Dawn has learnt. 
“The work on these choke points, identified at Khayaban-i-Jinnah, Khayaban-i-Firdausi, Pine Avenue, Raiwind Road, Johar Town and Wapda Town, has been launched and is currently underway. 
An official, privy to the development, expressed hope that construction-related works would complete soon. 
According to a proposal prepared and floated by the Tepa chief engineer and approved by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) governing body in a recent meeting, the Punjab government has taken an initiative to identify the traffic choke points to provide relief to the public by combating the smog-related issues in the Punjab capital.  
In this regard, Tepa has been directed by CM Naqvi to survey the junctions and corridors of the city and prepare a plan for resolution of traffic issues at choke points. 
The proposal further reveals that some surveys were conducted and plans for rectification of the issues observed at different choke points and intersections were prepared. The plans, along with the rough cost estimation, were presented to the CM in a meeting on Nov 9. The CM appreciated the efforts of Tepa to resolve the traffic issues for alleviation of smog and directed the officials to submit a working paper for seeking administrative approval amounting to Rs700m from the CM-led LDA’s governing body. 
It mentions that the choke points included Qadir Topbash Chowk (Khyaban-i-Jinnah) that requires remodeling of the roundabout with protected U-turns along the Pine Avenue before exiting the roundabout, overlay on the area and installation/fixing of the road safety devices such as studs (cat’s eyes), lane marking, signage etc. The remodeling of this intersection will help the government reduce smog and carbon emissions through uninterrupted traffic flow. 
The other choke points included Khokhar Chowk (Johar Town) that required remodeling with provision of slip roads, overlay on the area, road safety devices etc, Gajjumata Chowk (Ferozepur Road) requiring remodeling through protected U-turns, median line along Hadiara Drain road, overlay, road safety devices etc, Jorray Pul Chowk, EME Chowk (Link Canal Bank Road starting from Thokar Niaz Baig towards EME Society and other localities) and Nishtar Chowk on Ferozepur Road. The total cost to be incurred to remodel these choke points included Rs195m, Rs105m, Rs120m, Rs110m, Rs120m and Rs50m, respectively. 
The approval of funds for these schemes under the maintenance and repair head has also been accorded by the governing body under which 50pc of the funds would be provided by the Punjab government. The remaining 50pc of the funds would be arranged by the LDA from its own financial sources. 
“The work on these schemes is being completed at a fast pace and hopefully the intersections and choke points would be remodeled within the next 15 days or so,” the official said.

LAHORE: The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which is exploring every avenue to find support for its chairman contesting the Feb 8 general elections from Lahore’s NA-127 constituency, denies the impression that the party and the PML-N are ‘facilitating’ each other in the upcoming polls.
“The impression of ‘friendly’ elections is wrong. The N League and the PPP are not facilitating each other,” claims PPP additional secretary general Zulfikar Ali Badr.
“Had it been the case [PML-N president] Shehbaz Sharif would have been contesting from Larkana instead of Karachi,” he argues replying to a questioner at a press conference here on Tuesday.
 
 

Flanked by party colleagues Aslam Gill, Mian Misbah, Faisal Mir and others, Badr, who is also in charge of the election campaign for NA-127, says Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will address a public meeting in the constituency on Jan 21. He says the chairman took a difficult and challenging decision to contest for the Lahore seat, which the party founder ZA Bhutto had won in the past.
Citing slain party chairperson Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s example, who had won from Lahore’s NA-94 constituency in 1988 and became prime minister, he hopes Bilawal too will win from NA-127 to claim the top office.
Badr, who is son of late PPP leader Jahangir Badr, says wherever Bilawal goes, he unifies the party and jiyalas shun their mutual disputes.
He regrets that whoever returned to the National Assembly from this constituency (NA-127) since 1988 ignored the area in terms of development and the people were facing innumerable issues there. It exposed the so-called performance of the PML-N as barring a few major arteries all other roads and streets in Lahore are in a shambles, he adds.
The PPP leader says the new delimitation of the NA-127 has created five provincial assembly seats under it, instead of the previous two, as is the case in other NA constituencies.
He says that from PP-160 (which falls under NA-127) Mian Misbah will contest and Faisal Mir from PP-161, while a decision the remaining Punjab Assembly seats will be taken within a day.
Mr Gill says Bilawal’s decision of contesting from Lahore will also positively impact other constituencies of Lahore as well as other districts in central Punjab.
Mir hopes the PPP will beat its political rivals in their stronghold on Feb 8.
Referring to the PPP’s election 10-point manifesto, Mian Misbah says that fulfilling these promises in five year-term won’t be a big deal.
Meanwhile, the PPP has paced up its efforts to seek support of smaller groups for its chairman in NA-127.
PPP provincial leader Mian Ateeq visited the Pakistan Awami Tehreek elders on Tuesday and discussed with them the political situation with reference to NA-127.

LAHORE: Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi formally inaugurated a campaign on Tuesday for desilting over 17,000-km canals in the province, with various quarters commending the activity as pro-farming and farmer-friendly.
In a ceremonial act, the chief minister operated a crane and used a hoe to loosen and remove silt from the bed of Lahore Canal. This desiltation campaign has been initiated after almost a decade.  
The first phase of the campaign will continue until Jan 31, with the second phase involving the repair of embankments of 5,000-km-long canals over two months.  
This effort aims to make water available to an additional 0.3 to 0.4 million acres of land.
Mr Naqvi stated that the services of LIMS have been enlisted for round-the-clock monitoring of the desiltation drive through satellite images. The concerned staff, commissioners, and deputy commissioners have received training for this purpose. He mentioned that Nespak would also monitor the work as a third party.
Addressing concerns about drainage water being mixed in the Lahore Canal at some points, Mr Naqvi announced the formation of a committee comprising Wasa managing director and the deputy commissioner to investigate the matter. He appealed to citizens to avoid polluting the canal, emphasizing that the government cannot address all issues alone.
Tehreek-i-Istaqlal President Rehmat Khan Wardag expressed appreciation for Mr Naqvi’s initiative in launching the desiltation campaign.
He said desiltation on such a large scale had not been undertaken for a long time, the last instance being during the Musharraf regime.

LAHORE: The Punjab Council of the Arts (PCA) is taking some new initiatives to promote art and cultural activities at a fast pace, including setting up art councils in 18 more districts of the province and empowering them through boards of governors. It has also scheduled some programmes for children all over Punjab. 
PCA Executive Director Dr Syed Bilal Haider told Dawn the council took visual art as an important entity and started calligraphy and painting classes in all the divisional and district art councils.

That’s why establishment of a new art councils in the first phase are being done in Jhang, Vehari, Muzaffargarh, Mianwali, Chakwal and Rahim Yar Khan while in second phase, the work has been started to establish arts councils in remaining 18 districts,” Mr Haider said. 
To empower divisional and district arts councils, including the financial matters, establishment of boards of management in all councils had been introduced while a public-private partnership model had been introduced for first time in arts councils in the form of a board of management that will set the long-term and short-term goals for the arts councils, he added. 
“Entrepreneurship is also being implemented to provide interest-free loans to students from art and culture disciplines, artisans and artists to do business in the cultural industry and to keep the dying art skills alive.” 
Mr Haider said a cinema in Murree, under the local arts council, had been restored and the Murree Museum and Art Gallery had been established there. The arts council, he added, had signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with 22 universities that had the departments of art and culture for innovative and research-based work for the promotion of art and culture. 
He said efforts were being made to preserve and practice dying music instruments and dying music art skills. The introduction of visual art classes would be a game-changer for smaller cities, which had immense talent among the youth, especially both in visual and performing arts.  
Dr Haider said that a talent hunt programme in music from district to provincial level would also be introduced and the age bracket for the talent hunt would be 12-18 years and 18-25 years. The programme would be unveiled from the second week of February.  
To this question that what council was doing regarding the reintroduction of its dance ensemble which no more existed now, Haider said the council had started classes in all divisions and districts of performing arts, including those of Kathak and acting, and hoped that the possibility of having a dance troupe on a permanent basis might be considered in the future.

TOBA TEK SINGH: The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) is being established to counter the increasing incidents of cybercrimes, and stringent measures are being implemented to control smuggling.
This was stated by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Rai Ijaz Ahmad, who addressed the business community at the FCCI, says a press release.
He advised FCCI members to transition to transparent transactions through government channels instead of making payments through “hawala hundi”.  
He said while 50 per cent of remittances through hawala hundi dealers are related to genuine businessmen, the FIA prefers to overlook unintentional irregularities on a “Mens Rea” basis.
“Our focus should be on dismantling the network of such dealers,” he said, quoting the Financial Action Task Force and mentioning that Pakistan was placed in the grey list due to alleged money laundering.  
Mr Ahmad said the FIA, in close collaboration with state organisations and businesspeople, has been working to remove Pakistan from the grey list, and a separate dedicated anti-money laundering circle has been created to address the issue.
He said the Financial Management Unit in the State Bank of Pakistan is monitoring available financial data, “red-flagging” dubious, irregular, and disproportionate transactions. A team of senior officers examines these cases and sends suspicious transactions to the relevant departments or agencies for further investigation.
Businessmen were urged to exercise caution and refrain from engaging in illegal practices, as the monitoring system is set to become more stringent in the coming days. He explained the jurisdiction of FIA and other departments, noting that tax matters generally fall under the ambit of the FBR. However, any forgery or fraudulent transaction invokes the involvement of FIA.  
He emphasised that businessmen should make payments directly to the parties instead of using irrelevant accounts.
Suspicion, he noted, may arise if a textile owner makes an out-of-proportion payment to a cement or steel bar unit. Investigations would become apparent if a transaction of billions of rupees is made through the bank account of a low-paid salaried person. Mr Ahmad said that fake invoices, seemingly aimed at saving 2-3% income tax, often extend to rebates of 17-18pc, with the involvement of FBR officials and bank staff in many cases.
He said that government agencies aim not to harass genuine businessmen, but conscious efforts should be made to eliminate Hawala Hundi and Benami accounts.  
Ahmad suggested that FCCI should organise an awareness session on this subject to sensitize and educate its members about the potential involvement in illegal practices, whether intentional or unintentional.
Regarding ponzi housing schemes, he said it falls under NAB and Anti-Corruption Establishment, but the FIA may intervene if electricity is provided to such schemes without NOCs. He said the prevalence of the informal economy in Pakistan but emphasized the need to shift towards the documented economy. Strict measures, he warned, would be taken to curb smuggling, and businessmen were advised to avoid engaging in this illegal practice.

BAHAWALPUR: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Shaukat Basra tendered an apology to the Lahore High Court (LHC) Bahawalpur Bench judge for his baseless claim on social media about acceptance of his election petitions against the rejection of his nomination papers from a Haroonabad constituency.
According to an official handout, Shaukat Basra appeared in the court of Mr Justice Sultan Tanveer Ahmed of LHC Bahawalpur Bench Election Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday.
In his confessional statement in the court, Basra submitted that learned judge’s court had not passed any order on his election appeal.
He sought an unconditional apology, saying that his social media post regarding acceptance of his petition was based on misunderstanding and was contrary to the facts.
Basra added that on issuing such unsuitable remarks on social media, he was submitting his whole-heatedly apology.
Justice Sultan Tanveer Ahmed said that it was enough that Shaukat Basra has realised his mistake.
Shaukat Basra, in a social media post, had claimed that the learned court had passed orders on his election petitions, accepting the plea.

The Election Commission on Tuesday sent the details of election symbols of political parties to the returning officers (ROs), according to which, the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians has been allotted the ‘arrow’ symbol, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Nazaryati ‘ballay baz’ (batsman), and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ‘tiger’.
According to details, the Election Commission sent letters to the ROs of national and provincial assemblies regarding the details of the election symbols for the upcoming general elections. The electoral body sent the election symbols of 145 political parties to the ROs.
In the letter, it was stated that the respective election symbol should be allotted to the candidates nominated by the political parties. “The election symbols of political parties should not be given to any independent candidate,” the ROs were instructed in a letter.
The ROs were directed to allot the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party the election symbol of an ‘eagle’, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement ‘kite’, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam ‘book’ and the Jamaat-e-Islami ‘scale’. The names of various political parties, including the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, were not included in the list of electoral symbols.

The symbols of these political parties have been withheld due to non-conduct of intra-party elections. Meanwhile, the appellate tribunals are expected to complete the process of hearing the appeals against acceptance or rejection of nomination papers of candidates for the general elections 2024 on Wednesday (today).
According to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) spokesperson on Tuesday, the tribunals headed by high court judges would conclude hearing of the appeals on Wednesday and the revised list of candidates would be published on Thursday.
“The withdrawal of nomination papers is scheduled for Jan 12 (Friday) and the final list of candidates will also be released on the same day,” he said. The allocation of election symbols to the candidates was slated for Jan 13 (Saturday), and the polling would take place on Feb 8, the spokesperson added.
Meanwhile, the appellate tribunals on Tuesday dismissed the appeals of Fawad Chaudhry and Murad Saeed, challenging the rejection of their nomination papers for contesting the upcoming elections. The appellate tribunal of the Lahore High Court's Rawalpindi bench dismissed Fawad's appeal against the decision taken by the returning officer, rejecting his nomination papers from NA-60 and NA-61, Jehlum. The rejection is a significant political setback for the former federal information minister.

Tribunal’s Justice Chaudhary Abdul Aziz, in announcing the decision, sustained all objections against Fawad and upheld the returning officer's verdict. The court revealed that Fawad concealed his wife's bank accounts and foreign trips, failed to submit an affidavit, and also obscured details about his movable and immovable assets.
Consequently, Fawad is now out of the election race, as is his wife Hiba Chaudhry who has already been disqualified. Advocate Faisal Chaudhry stated that the couple plans to challenge the tribunal's decision in a higher court.
Meanwhile, in Swat, the tribunal rejected PTI leader Murad Saeed's appeal and affirmed the RO's decision to reject his papers. The court noted that Murad's power of attorney lacked attestation, and he did not personally appear before the tribunal.
Murad had submitted papers for NA-3 and NA-4. Previously, an election tribunal in Rawalpindi recalled its decision of approving the nomination papers of former minister Fawad, while rejecting the nomination paper of his wife Hiba Chaudhry for not declaring assets.
The appellate tribunals in Punjab also rejected the appeal of senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and threw out the objections raised against the acceptance of the nomination papers of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz.
In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), meanwhile, several PTI heavyweights won the appeals against the rejection of their nomination papers by the ROs concerned during the scrutiny process that concluded last weekend.
Police remain in the crosshairs of terrorists in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as three more cops gave up their lives in the line of duty on Wednesday heightening concerns about the security situation ahead of the election scheduled for next month.
The situation in K-P’s southern and erstwhile tribal districts remains particularly volatile as 10 police officials have been martyred there in a series of attacks over the last three days. Elsewhere in the restive province, Pakistan Army killed two terrorists in Lakki Marwat district in a gunfight that also left two servicemen martyred.
Officials confirmed that four people, including three policemen, were martyred in a late Tuesday night assault on a police post in Kohat. Around one dozen heavily armed terrorists opened fire and hurled hand grenades at the post situated near Lachi Toll Plaza on the Indus Highway.
Three cops identified as head constables Amjad and Junaid, and constable Waqar embraced martyrdom. The fourth fatality has been identified as Noor Muhammad, an employee of the toll plaza.
Taking advantage of the darkness of night, the terrorists fled the scene unchallenged. A police contingent reached the post and mounted a manhunt for the attackers after cordoning off the area.
The FIR of the deadly attack was registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department Kohat Division police station.
The funeral of the martyred cops was offered at the Police Lines which was attended by K-P IG Akhtar Hayat Khan, Kohat GOC Maj Gen Zulfiqar Bhatti, RPO Sher Akbar, Kohat Division Commissioner Abid Khan, DPO Farhan Khan and relatives of the martyrs.
The K-P IGP and officials of the local police, army and district administration presented a salute to the martyrs and laid a floral wreath on their coffins. Later, the bodies were dispatched to their ancestral villages for burial.

Speaking on the occasion, the K-P police chief said that such cowardly acts would not lower the morale of his force, noting that the police were performing their duty more vigorously to maintain peace in the province.
It was the third deadly attack on the police during the last three days. Two policemen escorting polio vaccinators were martyred while three others injured in a gunfight with terrorists in the Teri Ram area of Bannu district. On January 8, five policemen were martyred and 27 people were injured in a blast near a police van in Mamund tehsil of Bajaur district.
Meanwhile the military’s media wing said that security forces and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire in Lakki Marwat on Wednesday. Two terrorists were “sent to hell” during the exchange of fire as “own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”, reads the ISPR statement.
The dead terrorists have been identified as Aftab, alias Malang, and Masood Shah. “These terrorists remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces as well as target killings of innocent civilians. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from them,” the ISPR added.
According to the military statement, two soldiers identified as Sepoy Muhammad Afzal and Sepoy Ibrar Hussain embraced martyrdom during the intense exchange of fire.
“A sanitisation operation is being carried out to eliminate any terrorists found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it added.
 
 
Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi – who faces charges of misconduct – on Wednesday resigned as a judge of the Supreme Court, saying it was no longer possible for him to continue holding this position.
Justice Naqvi is accused of misconduct and  embroiled in ongoing proceedings at the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) in this connection.
A day earlier, the apex court turned down Justice Naqvi’s plea to halt the ongoing SJC misconduct proceedings against him.
Justice Naqvi tendered his resignation to President Dr Arif Alvi, in which he wrote that it was an honour for him to serve as the judge of the Lahore High Court and then the Supreme Court.
"In the circumstances which are a matter of public knowledge and to some extent public record, it is no longer possible for me to continue to serve as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan," Justice Naqvi wrote in his resignation.
“Considerations of due process also compel. I, therefore, effective today resign as judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” he added.
Justice Naqvi may now be entitled to pension and other privileges after his resignation. If the SJC had removed him for misconduct, he would have lost these benefits.

After the president accepts Justice Naqvi’s resignation, the posts of two judges at the top court will become vacant.
Interestingly, Justice Naqvi wrote the year 2023 in his resignation letter.
However, the error was rectified when the Aiwan-e-Sadr pointed it out.
In a letter sent to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and all SC judges in December, Justice Naqvi wrote that the treatment meted out to him by the SJC was “nothing short of disgraceful”.
Ten complaints accusing Justice Naqvi of misconduct were pending in the SJC.
In October last year, the SJC issued a show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi in connection with the complaints lodged against him and directed the judge to submit a reply within two weeks.
Headed by CJP Isa, the SJC includes Justice Tariq Masood, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, and Balochistan High Court CJ Naeem Akhtar.
In a preliminary reply submitted to the council in November, Justice Naqvi cited “serious prejudice” against him, demanding that CJP Isa, Justice Masood and CJ Akhtar should recuse themselves and not hear the matter.
On November 20, Justice Naqvi challenged the SJC proceedings against him and also contested the show-cause notice issued to him by the council, maintaining that the initiation of proceedings was coram non-judice and without lawful authority.
Later, the SJC issued a fresh show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi on November 22, directing him to file his reply within 14 days.
On December 4, Justice Naqvi again approached the top court and expressed his intent to pursue the constitutional petition he had moved earlier seeking to quash the revised show-cause notice issued by the SJC.

After a couple of days, Justice Naqvi drew the attention of the SC committee comprising three senior-most judges towards the silence over his petitions challenging the issuance of the show-cause notice despite the lapse of time as stipulated in the Supreme Court (Practice & Procedure) Act, 2023.
On December 15, the SJC in an open hearing gave two weeks to Justice Naqvi to respond to the misconduct allegations and directed him to submit a reply to the show-cause notice by January 1.
Later, the judge filed a detailed response to the show-cause notice, claiming that the allegations against him were “absolutely and maliciously false”.
He added that the SJC was not empowered to entertain any complaint against a judge and was only entitled to receiving “information”.
On January 8, Justice Naqvi withdrew his objection to the three-judge bench hearing his plea challenging the issuance of a show-cause notice to him.
On Tuesday, a three-member SC bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Musarrat Hilali dismissed Justice Naqvi's petition to halt the ongoing misconduct proceedings at the SJC.
In a symbolic order, the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the death sentence handed down to the late former military ruler, Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf, by a special court in a high treason case.
A four-judge bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, and comprising Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Aminuddin Khan and Athar Minallah, took up appeals related to the Lahore High Court’s January 13, 2020 order.
The LHC in its order declared the special court, which handed down the death sentence to Musharraf on December 17, 2019, as “unconstitutional”.
The SC issued separate orders on the matter of the appeal against the death penalty decision and the petition filed against the LHC declaring the special court ‘illegal’.
In one of the orders, the SC dismissed the appeal under Section 431 of the Criminal Code because of the lack of appearance of the legal heirs of Musharraf.
It declared that as a result of the termination of the appeal, the death sentence handed down by the special court in the high treason case would remain upheld.
The court observed that the former general’s legal heirs could not be contacted despite making efforts.
According to the SC’s order, notices were given to Musharraf’s heirs regarding the court proceedings at both their local and international residential addresses. Advertisements were also released in Urdu and English newspapers.
The SC noted in its order that there were two questions before the court: whether or not an appeal could be heard after the person had passed away, and if the death penalty was upheld, would Musharraf's legal heirs be entitled to his benefits.
The decision further stated that despite several attempts, Musharraf's heirs could not be contacted. “We have no option but to retain the death penalty,” the order read.
In the other matter, the court issued a short order annulling the LHC decision to declare the special court as unconstitutional.
During the proceedings, Additional Attorney General Aamir Rehman told the court that the government opposed Musharraf's appeal.
Hamid Khan and Salman Safdar, the lawyers for Musharraf, appeared before the court.
Hamid asserted that the request before the SC aimed to overturn the LHC order was a "constitutional matter” and his client’s "criminal appeal" should be considered separately.
Addressing Hamid, CJP Isa observed that he had completed his arguments in the constitutional matter and the court had to hear the criminal appeal.
“These are two separate matters and both have to be decided separately,” he added.
Safdar said in his arguments that there were no instructions from the former military ruler’s family.
He added that the family was aware of the case, further informing the court that they were contacted over 10 times since November last year.
“No instructions were given for, or against the case. Hence, I am not representing Pervez Musharraf's family,” he continued.
Justice Shah observed that the SC had also issued notices to Musharraf directly, to which Safdar added that the top court had also notified him through a newspaper advertisement.
“I can provide judicial assistance on two situations,” the lawyer said. To this, Justice Shah told Safdar that he could assist the court only on the legal situation.
Justice Aminuddin noted that the crucial question in this case was that Musharraf never surrendered himself before the court.
CJP Isa observed that that a way could be worked out for Musharraf not surrendering before the court as he was abroad and sick.
He continued that the real question was that none of his legal heirs appeared before the court either.
Justice Athar Minallah remarked that under Article 12, the court’s doors were open against everyone involved in imposing the emergency with Musharraf. To this, Safdar responded that the ex-military ruler was not involved in the act alone.
“The then prime minister, law minister, parliament and SC judges were also involved in it with him,” he said, adding that the special court sentenced Musharraf without hearing him.
“One man was singled out and punished for his actions against the whole country,” he argued.
Following this, the CJP called for taking a five-minute break, stating that the apex court wished to decide the case today.
As the hearing resumed, CJP Isa observed that the court could not hear the ex-military dictator’s lawyer in the absence of his legal heirs.
“Decisions should not be based on assumptions,” he observed, adding that the court did not want to close any door on the heirs.
“How can the court resort to the use of 561-A?” he questioned.
Appreciating the action taken by the SC, Safdar informed that Musharraf's heirs did not reside in Pakistan.
The CJP asked Safdar what his reservations were over the LHC.
To which the lawyer said that he does not even appear in the SC before the judge, who tried Musharraf in the LHC.
“I will definitely make some reports in your chamber about this,” Safdar said.  However, he was discouraged by the CJP, who pointed out that they did not call anyone in the chamber.
 In a sigh of relief for the embattled Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday declared “illegal” the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to revoke the PTI’s ‘bat’ electoral symbol and reject its intra-party polls.
In the short order, the PHC said that the ECP order was “illegal, without any lawful authority and of no legal effect”.
The court instructed the ECP to publish the certificate submitted by PTI after its internal polls on the commission's website. Moreover, it affirmed PTI's entitlement to the election symbol in accordance with sections 215 and 217, along with other applicable provisions of the Election Act, 2017, and Election Rules, 2017.
The verdict was announced by a two-member bench, comprising Justice Ejaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali, in response to a joint petition filed by PTI Chairman Gohar Khan and six other leaders. The petition sought the court's intervention to invalidate the ECP's order, arguing it was illegal and beyond jurisdiction.
On December 22, the electoral watchdog invalidated PTI's internal elections, resulting in the withdrawal of the party's iconic ‘cricket bat’ symbol.
However, on December 26, the PHC, presided over by a single judge Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel, suspended the commission’s decision to nullify the PTI's intra-party polls and revoke its 'cricket bat' symbol.
The court in its order had directed the commission to publish the PTI’s certificate on its website and restore the electoral symbol of the party.
The ECP held a meeting following the PHC’s decision. The commission then decided to challenge the PHC decision through an intra-court appeal filed on December 30, 2023.
As the hearing commenced on Wednesday, Justice Anwar remarked that the 'ladla' (blue-eyed boy) title keeps switching from person to person.
Advocate Qazi Javed stated that his client and PTI’s former district general secretary came to know about the intra-party polls from the media, mentioning that Javed wanted to participate in the party polls; but was not given the opportunity.
Advocate Javed stated that he also approached the ECP in this regard. Upon Justice Anwar’s inquiry on whether all members or just provincial representatives were elected in the polls, Javed remarked that the representatives of the entire country were elected.
The counsel maintained that if PTI is demanding a level playing field, then it should provide the same to its party workers as well.
The lawyer for petitioner Jahangir from Charsadda, Naveed Akhtar, stated that his client was the PTI's district president and was dismissed from the party over a statement. Naveed claimed that PTI did not elect officials as per the constitution, maintaining that every party should abide by its constitution.
Justice Ali inquired whether there could be a penalty for intra-party elections or was any action taken by the electoral watchdog, to which the lawyer replied that no action was taken by the election commission.
The counsel for the complainant argued that the ECP should have ensured that the intra-party polls were held under Section 208.
PTI lawyer Barrister Ali Zafar, while presenting his arguments, said he wanted to clarify the principle of jurisdiction in the case. He said that under Article 199, the PHC is empowered to hear the party's plea as the intra-polls were held in Peshawar - which falls under the jurisdiction of the PHC.
He further said that the party's chairman also belongs to K-P and when asked about the general secretary, he replied it is Umar Ayub.
Justice Anwar remarked that if the intra-party election was against the constitution, ECP neither issued the party a show-cause notice nor any punishment and added that the election body only nullified PTI's intra-party polls.

In a related development, the PTI retracted its application for the allotment of its election symbol from the Supreme Court, following which the apex court dismissed the application on withdrawal grounds.
In a hearing presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar stepped forward, expressing the intent to withdraw the application.
ECP meeting
Meanwhile, the ECP has called an important meeting in the wake of the PHC’s ruling. Scheduled to take place today morning at the ECP Secretariat, the meeting will be presided over by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja. Alongside the CEC, the session will include the participation of the four members of the ECP and special secretaries.
The primary agenda of the meeting will be a comprehensive discussion on the Peshawar High Court's decision regarding the allotment of election symbol to the PTI. The ECP will provide a detailed briefing to its law wing, focusing particularly on the legal aspects pertinent to the judgment
 
Supreme Court senior judge Ijazul Ahsan has raised concerns about the manner in which the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is conducting proceedings on complaints filed against another SC judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi. Justice Ahsan, who is also a part of the five-member SJC, has called for the withdrawal of the show cause notice issued to Justice Naqvi on November 22.
The judge on Tuesday issued his 4-page opinion highlighting the reasons why he disagreed with the majority verdict to issue show cause notices to Naqvi. "Before I set out my reasons, I wish to say something about the manner in which these [SJC] proceedings are being conducted. Unfortunately, in my opinion, proceedings are being conducted in undue haste contrary to established norms," he said.
According to the judge, the council, entrusted as it is with enormous constitutional responsibilities under Article 209 of the Constitution, is a body that must act with deliberate care and after full, frank and detailed discussion. “This is especially so where there is no unanimity and some members (or even one member) are inclined to disagree with [the] majority. This approach has been entirely lacking in the present proceedings. Debate and discussion has been non-existent and has not been permitted."
Read SC dismisses plea to stay SJC proceeding against Justice Naqvi
Justice Ahsan said the SJC proceedings on November 22, 2023, when it issued the second notice to Justice Naqvi, were completely devoid of any discussion or deliberation whatsoever. This manner of proceedings, he said, has cast an unwelcome doubt over the whole process. “I, therefore, disagree with the process followed and the manner in which the proceedings are being conducted," he added.
Justice Ahsan described the allegation levelled against Justice Naqvi as being utterly without merit or substance, both in law and even on a prima facie appraisal of the facts. He said most of the allegations relate to various properties and alleged transactions in relation to the same and pointed the finger at Justice Naqvi’s sons.
"The sons are lawyers in practice and are persons of independent means. They are effectively being condemned unheard. This, and the allegations themselves, are directly contrary to the findings recorded in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa and others v President of Pakistan and others case.”
Read Naqvi withdraws objections to SC bench
He said reference may be made to the "obligation of a Judge as to the knowledge of financial matters of his or her financially independent family members". "The same is true for allegation No 10, which again implicates the sons of the respondent judge [Naqvi]. As a matter of law, these allegations are unsustainable and cannot be leveled against the judge.’
He noted that allegation No 1 is that the respondent judge is “approachable”, adding that it is a highly noxious claim based entirely on some leaked audio conversations or judicial orders. “The law in respect of both is well settled. No judicial order can be the basis for proceedings under Article 209. This is settled beyond doubt,” he added.
Referring to the SJC’s October 27 proceedings when the council issued its first show cause to Justice Naqvi, he said on that day around twenty complaints were dismissed as they were about judicial orders of various judges. He said the law is equally well settled as regards the use of audio or video clips in any proceedings.
“The making of this allegation, and its inclusion in the show cause notice, [is] in clear violation of settled law. The instant show cause notice [should] never have been issued. It should be recalled forthwith," he said.
NEW YORK: A massive winter storm moving across the eastern half of the US on Tuesday ahead of a forecast brutal freeze this weekend knocked out power to over 302,000 homes and businesses in nine states.
The hardest hit states so far were Georgia with over 65,000 power outages, Florida with over 62,000 outages and Alabama with over 58,000 outages, according to data from PowerOutage.us.
Southern Co operates the biggest power companies in Georgia and Alabama, while NextEra Energy is the biggest power provider in Florida.
Extreme weather is a reminder of the February freeze in 2021 that left millions in Texas and other US Central states without power, water and heat for days, and a winter storm in December 2022 — known as Elliott in the energy industry — which almost caused power and natural gas systems to collapse in parts of the eastern half of the country. The current storm is blanketing an area from Minnesota in the north to Alabama in the south and from Kansas in the west to North Carolina in the east, according to AccuWeather.com. It is moving toward the US East Coast and the Northeast.
The storm is coming ahead of what will likely be the most frigid weather in over a year since the December 2022 storm blanketed much of the eastern half of the country, according to data from financial firm LSEG.
LSEG projected that natural gas demand, used to heat about half the homes in the country, would reach a daily record of 169.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Monday, Jan 15. That is Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the record gas use, which includes exports, is expected even though many businesses and government offices will be closed for a long US holiday this weekend.

WASHINGTON: The World Bank warned on Tuesday that global growth in 2024 is set to slow for a third year in a row, prolonging poverty and debilitating debt levels in many developing countries.
Hamstrung by the Covid-19 pandemic, then the war in Ukraine and ensuing spikes in inflation and interest rates around the world, the first half of the 2020s now looks like it will be the worst half-decade performance in 30 years, it added.
Global GDP is likely to grow 2.4pc this year, the World Bank forecast in its latest Global Economic Prospects report. That compares to 2.6pc in 2023, 3.0pc in 2022 and 6.2pc in 2021 when there was a rebound as the pandemic ended.
That would make growth weaker in the 2020-2024 period than during the years surrounding the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, the late 1990s Asian financial crisis and downturns in the early 2000s, World Bank Deputy Chief Economist Ayhan Kose told reporters.
Excluding the pandemic contraction of 2020, growth this year is set to be the weakest since the global financial crisis of 2009, the development lender said.
It forecasts 2025 global growth slightly higher at 2.7pc, but this was marked down from a June forecast of 3.0pc due to anticipated slowdowns among advanced economies. The World Bank’s goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 now looks largely out of reach, with economic activity held back by geopolitical conflicts.
“Without a major course correction, the 2020s will go down as a decade of wasted opportunity,” World Bank Group Chief Economist Indermit Gill said in a statement.
“Near-term growth will remain weak, leaving many developing countries especially the poorest stuck in a trap, with paralysing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people,” Gill added.
US spending strong
This year’s lackluster outlook comes after 2023 global growth came in an estimated 0.5 percentage point higher than forecast in June as the US economy outperformed due to strong consumer spending.
The US economy grew 2.5pc in 2023, 1.4 percentage points higher than its June estimate, the World Bank said. It forecast growth this year to slow to 1.6pc as restrictive monetary policy restrains activity amid diminished savings but said this was twice the June estimate.
The eurozone’s picture is considerably bleaker, with growth this year forecast at 0.7pc after high energy prices resulted in just 0.4pc growth in 2023. Tighter credit conditions prompted a 0.6 percentage point cut to the region’s 2024 outlook from the bank’s June forecast.
China weakens further
China also is weighing on the global outlook as its growth slows to a forecast 4.5pc in 2024. That marks its slowest expansion in over three decades outside of the pandemic-affected years of 2020 and 2022.
The forecast was cut 0.1 percentage point from June, reflecting weaker consumer spending amid continued property sector turmoil, with 2025 growth seen slowing further to 4.3pc.
“More generally though, weaker growth in China reflects the economy returning to a path of weakening potential growth due to an aging and shrinking population, rising indebtedness that constrains investment and in a sense, narrowing opportunities for productivity to catch up,” Kose told reporters.
Emerging market and developing economies as a group are forecast to grow 3.9pc this year, down from 4.0pc in 2023 and a full percentage point below their average in the 2010s.

WASHINGTON: A historic commercial US mission to the Moon failed after suffering a critical loss of fuel, organisers admitted on Tuesday, ending for the time being America’s hopes of placing its first spacecraft on the lunar surface since the Apollo era.
Fixed to the top of United Launch Alliance’s new Vulcan rocket, Astrobotic’s Peregrine Lunar Lander blasted off on Monday from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, then successfully separated from its launch vehicle.
But a few hours later, Astrobotic began reporting malfunctions, starting with an inability to orient Peregrine’s solar panel towards the Sun and keep its battery topped up, owing to a propulsion glitch that also damaged the spacecraft’s exterior. The company said it had “no chance of soft landing” on the Moon.
NASA had paid the company more than $100 million to ship scientific hardware to a mid-latitude region of the Moon to answer questions about the surface composition and radiation in the surrounding environment, as it prepares to send astronauts back to Earth’s nearest neighbor later this decade.
Man on Moon plan pushed back
The United States has pushed back its planned return of astronauts to the Moon’s surface from 2025 to 2026, Nasa administrator Bill Nelson said on Tuesday.
Its first mission, an uncrewed test flight to the Moon and back called Artemis 1, took place in 2022, after several postponements. Artemis 2, involving a crew that doesn’t land on the surface, has been postponed from later this year to September next year.
Artemis 3, in which the first woman and first person of colour are to set foot on lunar soil at the Moon’s south pole, should now take place in Sept 2026.

LONDON: The former boss of Britain’s Post Office said on Tuesday she will return a royal honour received from Queen Elizabeth II as public anger mounts over a miscarriage of justice scandal.
Ex-CEO Paula Vennells said she had  “listened” to the growing clamour to hand back the CBE (Commander of the British Empire) honour given to her in 2018 and decided to relinquish it.
A petition calling for her to be stripped of the CBE, handed out  “for services to the Post Office and to charity”, had garnered more than a million signatures by the start of this week.
It follows renewed focus on what has been described as Britain’s biggest ever miscarriage of justice, which saw hundreds of subpostmasters wrongly convicted of theft because of a glitch in accounting software. “I have listened and I confirm that I return my CBE with immediate effect,” Vennells said in a statement.
“I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system.” Lives were ruined by the false accusations that led to some Post Office branch managers being jailed, going bankrupt, losing their homes and their health.
Four people took their own lives and dozens of those since exonerated died without seeing their names cleared.

WASHINGTON: Meta on Tuesday said it was tightening up content restrictions for teens on Instagram and Facebook as it faces increased scrutiny that its platforms are harmful for young people.
The changes come months after dozens of US states accused Meta of damaging the mental health of children and teens, and misleading users about the safety of its platforms.
In a blog post, the company run by Mark Zuckerberg said it will now  “restrict teens from seeing certain types of content across Facebook and Instagram even if it’s from friends or people they follow.” This type of content would include content that discusses suicide or self-harm, as well as nudity or mentions of restricted goods, the company added.
Restricted goods on Instagram include tobacco products and weapons as well as alcohol, contraception, cosmetic procedures and weight loss programmes, according to its website.
In addition, teens will now be defaulted into the most restricted settings on Instagram and Facebook, a policy that was in place for new users and that now will be expanded to existing users.

KINMEN: Spikes jut from the beaches of Taiwan’s Kinmen island, military checkpoints serve as traffic roundabouts and bunkers double up as tourist cafes — reminders everywhere of the conflict decades earlier with Chinese communist forces.
Kinmen, which lies 200 kilometres from Taiwan island but only seven kilometres from the Chinese mainland, was a battlefield frontline for the nationalists who fled to Taiwan in 1949, and the target of frequent bombardments up until 1979.
Now Kinmen residents are preparing to vote in a crucial presidential election on Saturday that is being watched closely from Beijing to Washington, and whose winner will set democratic Taiwan’s course over the next four years.
“Xiamen, Kinmen — their doors face each other,” said Lin Ma-teng from his courtyard home on Lieyu, Kinmen’s closest inhabited islet to China.
The southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen, which Lin refers to, is close enough to Kinmen to be clearly visible across the narrow strait. “Big guns, small guns, they shell at each other,” the 79-year-old former serviceman said. “Thankfully, Kuomintang held Kinmen,” he added, referring to the nationalists who today make up Taiwan’s oldest political party.
One-time opponents of the Chinese Communist Party, Kuomintang (KMT) has evolved into a political bloc that today sees the economic fortunes of modern Taiwan linked to a close relationship with Beijing.
China has long claimed Taiwan as part of its territory, with President Xi Jinping — who has never ruled out the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control — describing  “unification” as  “inevitable”.
‘Already independent’
For the majority of the island’s 23 million people accustomed to democratic life, joining authoritarian China is unthinkable. In Taiwan’s election, KMT candidate Hou Yu-ih is going up against Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has shaped its platform on sovereignty from China.
The previous vote in 2020 saw a historic landslide for the DPP’s Tsai Ing-wen, who enraged China with her stance that Taiwan is  “already independent”. Over Tsai’s eight-year tenure, Beijing refused to engage with her government, ramping up tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
Besides sending in unprecedented numbers of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan, Beijing also staged two massive war games in recent years — flying missiles to surrounding waters and simulating a blockade of the island. These actions have upped global worries of a conflict, even if it is  “unlikely in the near term”, Amanda Hsiao of the International Crisis Group said.
“The extent to which tensions will be kept under check in the next four years will depend on how the next president approaches defence reform, and manages relations with Beijing and Washington.” 
‘Future of democracy’
China’s bombardments of Kinmen only stopped in 1979 when the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing. This is a position maintained today even as Washington becomes Taipei’s most important ally and its key weapons provider.
Meanwhile, US-China relations have plummeted, with the two superpowers tussling over technology exports, spying concerns and human rights issues — but also on the status of Taiwan.

THIMPHU: Former prime minister Tshering Tobgay’s party won Bhu­tan’s election on Tues­day, media reported, after polls dominated by economic threats challenging the Himalayan kingdom’s longstanding policy of prioritising  “Gross National Happ­iness” over growth.
Foremost in the minds of many who voted are the struggles facing the Buddhist-majority kingdom’s younger generation, with chronic youth unemployment and a brain drain.
Both parties in the election are committed to a constitutionally enshrined philosophy of a government that measures its success by the  “happiness and well-being of the people”.
Tobgay’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) won nearly two-thirds of seats in parliament, The Bhutanese newspaper reported, with the 58-year-old conservation advocate expected to become premier for the second time.
Tobgay’s PDP  “wins the 2024 National Assembly general elections with 30 seats” while the Bhutan Tendrel Party (BTP) took the remaining 17, the paper said, based on preliminary results from each constituency.
There was no immediate confirmation from the Election Commission, which is expected to release final results on Wednesday, according to an official timetable released ahead of the polls.
Some voters had to trek for days to cast their ballots in the landlocked mountain nation of about 800,000 people, similar in area to Switzerland.
“Job opportunities in Bhutan are scarce and the new government should focus on solving this, so young people don’t leave abroad for greener pastures,” said 22-year-old student Ugyen Tshering, after voting in the chilly mountain air in the capital Thimphu, with Buddhist prayer flags fluttering in the background.
Bhutan’s youth unemployment rate stands at 29 per cent, according to the World Bank, while economic growth has sputtered along at an average of 1.7pc over the past five years.

WASHINGTON: Videos and eyewitness accounts published in The Washington Post on Tuesday, show how Jewish settlers attacked the Palestinian village of Qusra, in Israeli-occupied West Bank, killing three people and forcing others to leave the village as Israeli soldiers watched silently.
The victims included 17-year-old Obada Saed Abu Srour, civil engineer Muath Raed Odeh, and 20-year-old Musab Abdel Halim Abu Rida.
These individuals lost their lives while attempting to protect their community from armed Israeli settlers who had been targeting Palestinian villages even before the Oct 7 Hamas raid.
In one of the videos, the attackers, masked and armed, can be seen targeting the home of blacksmith Awad Mahmoud Odeh, located close to the Esh Kodesh Israeli settlement.

Abu Srour was shot in the back, while attempting to escape the gunfire. Despite the obligation under international and Israeli law to protect all residents, including Palestinians, Israeli troops did not intervene forcefully.
The attackers, carrying pistols and an M16 rifle, clashed with residents, causing injuries and fatalities. Witnesses claim that Israeli soldiers, stationed at nearby military outposts, did not intervene, raising concerns about their adherence to military orders requiring the prevention of crimes.
The aftermath of the attack saw more than 800 Palestinians displaced from their West Bank homes in the following month, contributing to the escalation of violence between Isra­elis and Palestinians. The incident is currently under review by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), and police have initiated an active investigation.
The failure of Israeli authorities to respond effectively to the violence on Oct 11 has sparked criticism, with human rights lawyers pointing out a pattern of inaction in the face of settler attacks.
The evidence collected by The Washington Post raises questions about Israel’s commitment to protecting Palestinian residents in the West Bank, as the report pointed out.
Witnesses reported that the attackers intentionally collided with a car in the area and began shooting at it.
The assailants then proceeded to fire at several residents, prompting at least 12 Palestinians to flee north, seeking cover behind a large building away from the gunfire.
Local residents told investigators Israeli soldiers, stationed at two military outposts situated between the settlement and the village, did not intervene at all as the violence unfolded.
Visual evidence suggests that soldiers had clear views of the road where residents were fleeing and the building they sought refuge behind.
Despite the proximity of military forces to the attackers and the village, the invasion continued uninterrupted.
Eyewitnesses told journalists that the Israeli border police even cautioned residents not to attempt to stop the armed settlers. Only the police were allegedly authorised to confront the attackers, and since they did not, the villagers remained exposed to the violence with no protection from any side.
The incident reportedly unfolded over several hours, with the attackers leaving the village around 1.30pm after firing at residents.
The violence resumed later in the day when the settlers gathered outside Awad Odeh’s home, about half a mile from the initial attack. Israeli forces intervened only after violence subsided, ensuring that the attackers face no retaliation.
Prior knowledge
The report notes that the soldiers’ attitude “raises questions” about Israel’s willingness to protect Pale­stinians. “There’s evidence suggesting that the military had prior knowledge of the violence, yet failed to take timely action to prevent the tragic consequences,” the report added.
The incident is under review by the Israeli military and police, as human rights activists and UN officials demand accountability for the incident and the protection of Palestinian communities in the West Bank.
These quotes from the Washington Post report illustrate the attack was planned, how it unfolded, and how the Israeli soldiers allowed it to happen.
“To all the rats in the sewers of Qusra village, we are waiting for you and we will have no mercy. The day of revenge is coming,” threats sent via Facebook to residents of Qusra on Oct 9.
“He said he wanted to go and help. I told him there was no need… He said, ‘If I die, I die — I would be martyred.’”
Aya, mother of 17-year-old victim Obada Saed Abu Srour, recalls her conversation with her son on the fateful day.
“I saw on the [security] cameras there were settlers around our home destroying cars and shooting at windows,” said Awad Mahmoud Odeh, describing the attack on his home during the incident.
“As soon as we got 10 to 15 meters out of our home, they shot at my family and injured my daughter, and I got shot right after,” said Odeh, recounting his experience during the attack.
“It was like being in an action movie. I didn’t expect to come out alive.”
Explaining how they survived the attack, Odeh said: “We hid in the house, and they tried to get in, and they shot and swore at anyone they saw.”
Describing the moment when armed settlers attempted to break into his home, Odeh said: “I’ve never been in a position like this.
“There’s no doubt that [the Israeli army] should have stopped it. They should have detained [the settlers] until the police come and take them.”
Roni Pelli, a lawyer with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, expressed the view on the failure of Israeli forces to intervene. “There has been a serious problem of implementing the law… ’standing idly by,” Peli added.
“[The authorities] came to take the DVR to hide their atrocities. They had to hide it,” said Odeh on the removal of surveillance footage by Israeli authorities immediately after the attack.
“Authorities, in general, have received intelligence, including from security forces on the ground, regarding the identities of the people who committed that crime,” an anonymous Israeli official, addressing the intelligence and subsequent investigations.

GENEVA: The World Health Organisation warned on Tuesday its ability to provide aid and support struggling hospitals in Gaza was “shr­inking”, despite international dem­ands for more aid to be allowed in.
WHO staff described desperate scenes of seriously injured patients, including young children, begging for food in hospitals — which have seen most of their health workers flee for their own safety.
“We’re seeing this humanitarian catastrophe unfold before our eyes,” Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical coordinator, told reporters in Geneva via videolink from the Gaza Strip.
“We’re seeing the health system collapse at a very rapid pace,” he warned.
The Israeli army has claimed the operation is entering a new phase, involving troop reductions and more targeted operations in the territory’s centre and south.
But Casey said that on the ground, he had “not seen the lowering of the intensification”.
“What we are still seeing […] is a huge number of casualties related to hostilities, so shrapnel injuries, gunshot wounds, crush injuries from buildings that collapse. That’s still happening every single day.”
‘Recipe for disaster’
The United Nations says the Israeli aggression had left around 85 per cent of Gaza’s population of 2.4 million and left civilians in the besieged Palestinian territory at risk of famine and disease.
A UN Security Council resolution last month demanded that more aid be let in but the WHO said its access had only got worse.
“We’ve seen the shrinking of humanitarian space,” Casey said.
Israel has implied the United Nations is largely to blame for the lack of aid reaching those in need in Gaza. But Casey insisted the WHO and other UN organisations were “constantly trying to reach the areas in greatest need”.
“Every day we line up our convoys, we wait for clearance (from the warring parties) and we don’t get it,” he said. “And then we come back and we do it again the next day.”
The WHO has been unable to reach northern Gaza for the past two weeks, and has been forced to cancel six planned missions there.
The organisation said that only 15 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are even partially functioning, most of them in the south. The agency has long described desperate scenes in the few barely functioning hospitals remaining in the north, facing severe shortages of food, clean water, medicines and fuel.
And it warned that the situation was increasingly dire in the middle and south of the densley populated territory.
“Hostilities and evacuation orders in neighbourhoods of the middle area and Khan Yunis… are affecting access to hospitals for patients and ambulances, and making it incredibly complex for WHO to reach those hospitals to provide supplies and fuel,” said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories.

Wael Dahdouh, Al-Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief has faced a series of personal tragedies, each one hitting him hard. Almost half of his family has been lost to Israeli aggression, but he is determined to stand firm until he can.
Wael’s 27-year-old son, Hamza Dahdouh, became one of the latest Palestinian journalists to fall 
victim to an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, adding to the grief of the veteran reporter. Despite the heart-wrenching loss and the emotional scenes of mourning, Wael, a symbol of personal tragedy and unwavering determination for many in this war, pledged to continue his work.
During a televised address after his son’s funeral, he said that journalists in Gaza would persist in their work, undeterred by the challenging conditions they were forced to navigate.
“All the world needs to see what is happening here. Hamza was everything to me, the eldest boy, he was the soul of my soul… these are the tears of parting and loss, the tears of humanity,” he said. 

Global silence, lack of protection hurt ‘more than killing itself’, says Wael Dahdouh

“It is true that the pain of losing someone is very difficult and when it is about your eldest son after the death of the family, then it becomes even more difficult,” he told NBC News from Gaza later on Sunday as he comforted Hamza’s daughter, who kept weeping on his shoulder. 
Describing his son as ‘chivalrous’, ‘tender’ and ‘generous’, Mr Dahdouh vowed not to give up on reporting. 
“In the end, this does not change anything of reality, and will not change any of our decisions. We 
are going to proceed as long as we are alive and breathing. As long as we are able to do this duty and deliver this message,” he said.
A massacre 
“Journalists are facing a massacre, a bloodbath in Gaza,” Mr Dahdouh told NBC News. 
He further expressed that the global silence and absence of safeguarding for journalists operating in Gaza “hurts us more than the killing itself.”
“We are not a part in any conflict. We have a duty the world has promised to protect and we demand the entire world to guarantee the safety of the Palestinian journalists. We hope that Hamza’s killing is the last killing that happens,” he said. 
The journalist gained widespread recognition beyond the region when, in October, he discovered during a live broadcast that his wife, 15-year-old son, 7-year-old daughter, and grandson had lost their lives in an Israeli airstrike on Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. Astonishing many viewers, he returned to the airwaves the next day.
In December, Mr Dahdouh suffered injuries, and his cameraman lost his life in a drone strike while they were reporting on the aftermath of an airstrike on a school in southern Gaza. He has been the prominent face of his network’s continuous coverage of the war, earning a place in the hearts of viewers for his unwavering reporting despite the tragic loss of his family.
Since the start of the war, a minimum of 79 journalists have lost their lives — 72 were Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese, TIME Magazine reported. However, according to Al Jazeera and AFP figures, so far 109 journalists have been killed. This marks the deadliest period for media workers since the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) started recording journalist deaths in 1992.
Both the CPJ and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have expressed increasing concern that journalists are becoming deliberate targets for the Israeli military. United Nations (UN) has also expressed serious concerns over the rising count of journalists’ deaths in Gaza. Media workers across the globe have also condemned the brutal murders.

DUBAI: The pitch in Cape Town, where India beat South Africa inside five sessions of a Test match last week, has incurred one demerit point after being rated “unsatisfactory”, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday.
The Newlands contest lasted 642 balls with India registering a series-levelling victory in the shortest ever Test in which there has been a winner, beating Australia’s 656-ball victory over South Africa in 1932.
South Africa captain Dean Elgar, playing his farewell match, and India counterpart Rohit Sharma both felt the pitch was below-standard and many would feel the venue got away with a rather light punishment. 
“The pitch in Newlands was very difficult to bat on,” match referee Chris Broad said in an ICC statement. “The ball bounced quic­kly and sometimes alarmingly throughout the match, making it difficult to play shots. 
“Several batters were hit on the gloves and many wickets also fell due to the awkward bounce.” South Africa, electing to bat, were bundled out for 55 in their first innings and spinners were not used at all by either of the sides.
Hosts Cricket South Africa have 14 days to appeal against the sanction.
Under the ICC rules, “unsatisfactory” rating incur one demerit point, three points are slapped if a venue is found ‘unfit’ under the governing body’s pitch and outfield monitoring process.
These points will remain active for a rolling five-year period.
If a venue accumulates six demerit points in that period, it is suspended from hosting any international cricket for 12 months.

ADELAIDE: Wimbledon champion Mark­eta Vondro­usova pulled out of the Adelaide International with a hip injury Tuesday just days before the Australian Open, as Jelena Ostapenko set up a clash against Caroline Garcia. 
Czech world number seven Vondrousova began her season at the United Cup, beating Serbia’s Olga Danilovic and losing to China’s Zheng Qinwen. 
She was seeded three in Adelaide and due to play her first-round match on Tuesday evening. But the WTA said she had withdrawn, citing a hip injury. It was not clear how serious the problem was. 
Former French Open winner Ostapenko, the Latvian sixth seed and world number 12, needed three sets to get past Sorana Cirstea 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, enjoying a modicum of revenge after the Romanian beat her at Wimbledon last year. 
She lost serve twice in the first set before waking up. 
“I was sleeping in the first set, I’m not really a morning person,” she said after a morning start at Memorial Drive. “It took me time to wake up and get into the match. I’m glad I managed to win it.” 
Ostapenko recovered to win six games out of seven and reach 3-1 in the final set. The Latvian raced into a 5-2 lead but was broken serving for the match. She blew two match points at 5-3 before sealing victory with her sixth ace. 
“I like to play in Australia,” the 2023 Australian Open quarter-finalist said. “Conditions are good for me. Sometimes I get too worked up but then I calm down and play better.” 
She will next play former world number four Garcia, now ranked 20th, who also avoided an upset, coming from a break down in the final set to defeat Australian wildcard Taylah Preston 6-4, 1-6, 6-3. 
Germany’s Laura Siegemund, part of the country’s winning United Cup team, dismissed seventh seed Liudmila Samsonova 6-7 (1/7), 6-4, 6-4. 
Eighth seed Veronika Kudermetova also progressed, but former world number one Karolina Pliskova lost 6-2, 6-1 to qualifier Katerina Siniakova in an all-Czech match-up. 
STEPHENS OUSTED IN HOBART 
At the WTA Hobart International, Sloane Stephens’s Australian Open buildup suffered a blow after the former US Open champion lost 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) to China’s Yuan Yue in the first round. 
The duo slugged it out for nearly three hours before the Chinese world number 73 secured a memorable victory. 
Having split the first two sets, Yuan broke Stephens when the American was serving for the match at 6-5. Stephens led 5-4 in the tiebreak but could not hold on to her advantage. 
“I’m very happy and excited to win,” a beaming Yuan said. “She’s a Grand Slam champion. At home, I’d [often] watch her play on the TV. I’m happy to be here (playing against her),” she said of her opponent. 
Former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin began her campaign at the Melbourne Park warm-up event with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Greet Minnen of Belgium. 
Kenin, who saved all three break points she faced, will meet Daria Saville for a spot in the quarter-finals. 
Britain’s Emma Raducanu withdrew from a charity match in Melbourne on Tuesday, which was part of her Australian Open buildup, the BBC reported. 
Her original opponent Naomi Osaka had pulled out earlier and was replaced by Donna Vekic for the contest, which was cancelled.

AL HOFUF: Sebastien Loeb took stage four of the Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as home favourite Yazeed Al Rajhi stretched his overall lead in the car category.
Nine-time world rally champion Loeb, racing a Prodrive Hunter for the Bahrain Raid Xtreme team, finished the 299km stage from Al Salamiya to the oasis city of Al Hofuf one minute and eight seconds faster than Toyota’s Al Rajhi.
Qatar’s reigning champion Nasser Al-Attiyah, who had held a comfortable lead at the penultimate checkpoint, was third fastest in another Prodrive Hunter and moved up to third overall from fifth.
Al Rajhi now leads Audi’s Spanish triple Dakar winner Carlos Sainz, fourth in Tuesday’s stage, by four minutes and 29 seconds.
Loeb moved up to sixth overall from ninth, 23 minutes and 50 seconds off the lead, after the 49-year-old’s 24th career Dakar stage win and first this year.
The Frenchman was also the fifth different stage winner, including the prologue, in as many days.
“We did a clean stage. We were a bit in the dust for sure, because we started far back and we had to overtake a lot of cars,” said Loeb.
“At one point we missed a way point and had to go back for about 30 seconds, but for the rest we did a very good stage, so no problems.” 
Toyota’s American driver Seth Quintero hit trouble early in the stage, stopping with mechanical issues after 81km and requiring assistance that dropped him hours behind.
In the motorcycle category, Chilean Jose Ignacio ‘Nacho’ Cornejo took over at the top after his second stage win of this year’s event.
Botswana’s overnight leader Ross Branch reached the finish with twisted handlebars on his Hero machine and losing nearly four-and-a-half minutes to Cornejo, who leads him by a minute and 15 seconds.
“I thought Id try bent-style handlebars today. No, really it was a rough day for me, one of the days Id rather forget. I crashed after 40 km just trying to look at the roadbook and I hit a rock,” said Branch.
“Then I crashed again 20 km before the finish just going into the dunes. There was a bit of camel grass hidden in the sand and that threw me over the handlebars. But Im OK, the bike is repairable.”
American Ricky Brabec was third overall after finishing second in the stage.

MUNICH: German football fans should fill Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena to properly commemorate the life of Germany great Franz Beckenbauer who died aged 78 on Sunday, former team-mate and ex-Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on Tuesday.
Beckenbauer, who was Germany’s first truly global sports star and led them to the World Cup title as player and coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively, had become part of the country’s social fabric in a hugely successful career on and off the pitch spanning over 50 years.
Beckenbauer, considered one of the best players of all-time, won 103 caps and captained West Germany to World Cup success in 1974, two years after lifting the European title.
He also headed the organising committee for the 2006 World Cup held in Germany.
“The whole world of football and beyond is grieving for our friend Franz,” Rummenigge, who played alongside Beckenbauer at Bayern Munich in the 1970s, told Bild newspaper.
Rummenigge, a former longtime Bayern CEO, was West Germany’s captain under coach Beckenbauer in the 1986 World Cup where they lost to Argentina in the final.
“As a thank you and in remembrance FC Bayern should organise a commemoration in the stadium which would not have existed without him,” he said.
Bayern said on Tuesday the stadium would be illuminated to honour Beckenbauer for the coming days. 
“In memory of the ‘Kaiser’, the Allianz Arena will light up with  the words  “Thank you Franz” in the evening hours of 16:30 to 22:00 CET  over the coming days,” the club said. 
“To finish, the special illumination will also be seen... on  Friday night, during FC Bayern’s home match against Hoffenheim.”
The  Bundesliga resumes on Friday after the winter break. 
Beckenbauer was part of the mighty Bayern Munich team who won three consecutive European Cups from 1974-76 among other titles.
He became the team coach and club president after his playing career, establishing the German champions as one of the most successful and valuable brands in European football.
“Franz Beckenbauer was the leader of the German football for many  decades,” 1990 World Cup winner Juergen Klinsmann said.  “He was with  Pele the best player in the world in the 60s, 70s, 80s. He coached  us to win the World Cup, he won the World Cup. He brought the World Cup  to Germany 2006,” added Klinsmann, who now coaches the South Korean  national team. 
“He was almost like a father and so I think the football world is  very, very sad but especially Germany loses its most charismatic leader  in sports over the last many decades.”
The club, under the presidency of Beckenbauer, left the ageing Olympic stadium and moved to their purpose-built Allianz Arena in 2006.
A stadium ceremony is not the only proposal to remember the  “Kaiser”, a nickname he earned for his playing style and vision of the game.
Fellow 1974 World Cup winner Bertie Vogts suggested renaming the German Cup the Beckenbauer Cup to ensure his memory lives on.
“Maybe the German FA (DFB) should consider renaming for example the German Cup after Franz Beckenbauer,” Vogts told the Rheinische Post newspaper. “It is important that his name is not forgotten by the football generations that follow.”

KARACHI: Pakistan discard Ahmed Shehzad’s batting show stood out among a number of impressive performances on the first day of the fifth-round matches of the President’s Trophy, which are being held across three venues here on Tuesday.
The right-hander scored 77 runs off 111 balls to help Wapda post 328-6 against Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) at the UBL Sports Complex. Shehzad hit eight boundaries in his knock, which was complimented by Ayaz Tasawwar’s 75 off 146 (10 fours and a six).
The duo put up 141 runs for the third wicket before both were dismissed to leave the scorecard reading 216-4. However, a 65-run unbeaten partnership between Mohammad Saad (45 not out off 94) and Khalid Usman (35 not out off 40, a four and a six), boosted the team to a first-innings total of 328-6 in the allotted 80 overs.
Spinner Mubasir Khan (3-67) was the pick of the SNGPL bowlers, with his team ending the day at 13-0.

DOHA: Qatar go into the Asian Cup starting on Friday as hosts and holders but the shock axing of Carlos Queiroz as coach last month has thrown their title defence into serious question.
Prior to that, the talk was about how Qatar would right the wrongs of a disappointing early exit from their home World Cup just over a year ago.
Qatar’s three straight defeats was the worst performance of any World Cup host in history.
Former Real Madrid and Portugal coach Queiroz took over following the departure of Felix Sanchez, but in early December the Portuguese was sacked and replaced by Tintin Marquez.
Marquez is a familiar face to Qatari fans because he coached Al Wakrah in the domestic league and has a long relationship with football in the Gulf state.
“In football all the time there is pressure,” the 62-year-old Spaniard told AFP soon after his sudden appointment. “More important for the players is enjoying the match,” he said, downplaying the idea that his side was under pressure to make up for their World Cup flop.
Qatar open the Asian Cup on Friday when they face Lebanon at the 88,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, which staged the World Cup final.
Queiroz, who coached Iran at the World Cup and was assistant to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, had a four-year contract with Qatar. He won five, lost five and drew two during his tenure.
Qatar’s football association gave no reason for the decision to get rid of him and the move, and its timing, baffled many.
Former national team player Raed Yaqoub said Queiroz had started the  “positive” work of refreshing Qatar’s starting line-up to  “give other names a chance”.
Interfering with that, said the player-turned-pundit, was  “a big mistake”.
Yaqoub said that although Marquez is popular and well known in Qatar,  “I think that holding him responsible only a month before the tournament is a mistake”.
Mohamed Mubarak al-Mohannadi, another former national player, said the switch so close to the Asian Cup left the team  “facing the gun” given the difficulty  “for any coach to make the required transformation within a month’s period”.
Marquez’s first game in charge, at the end of December, was a 3-0 win over a Cambodia team which failed to qualify for the regional championship.
The Spaniard, who played for Espanyol, said it was  “important” that he knew Qatari football.
“I know the players, I know my mentality and I know... my idea for playing,” he said, explaining he was not  “arriving new”.
Publicly at least the players have welcomed his appointment.
Defender Tarek Salman told AFP the change meant the team would need to adapt to a Spanish style, but added:  “I think it’s going to fit us and we hope to achieve good things with the coach.”
He insisted that the expectations on the team were not the same as they had been going into the first World Cup in the Middle East.

TOKYO: Japan’s veteran midfielder Yasuhito Endo on Tuesday announced his retirement after 26 years of his career and joined Gamba Osaka as a coach.
“I had a really long and fulfilling 26 years of football life” between 1998 and 2023, Endo said in a video message posted on the club’s website. “I never thought I’d play this long,” the 43-year-old added.
Endo was in Japan’s World Cup squad for three times and was named Asian player of the year in 2009.
He won 152 Japan caps, a record.
Having spent nearly two decades at Gamba Osaka as a footballer, Endo said he’s  “very happy” to be back as a coach.
“As a coach, I am still learning... but I want to grow with the players and contribute to the team’s victories,” he said.
Kozo Tashima, president of the Japan Football Association, said Endo posses the ability  “to make decisions calmly” and  “high level of (football) skills.”
“I hope he will use his experience and achievements for the development of Japanese football.”

NAIROBI: Slain Ugandan athlete Benjamin Kiplagat will be laid to rest in his ancestral home in Kenya on Thursday, his family said.
The 34-year-old Kenyan-born Olympian was found dead on a road on the outskirts of the Rift Valley town of Eldoret in the early hours of New Year’s Eve with a stab wound to his neck.
Both Kenya and his adopted country Uganda have laid claim to the steeplechase runner, but his brother Vincent Chemweno told AFP on Tuesday he would be buried at the family farm in the village of Kamendi, more than 60 kilometres from Eldoret.
“We are making all the necessary arrangements for the funeral where we expect a host of fellow athletes and politicians,” said Chemweno.
Kiplagat had represented Uganda internationally in the 3,000m steeplechase, including at three Olympic Games and six World Championships.
Two men were charged in Kenya on Jan 2 over his death and were ordered detained for 21 days to enable police to continue investigations.
While the motive remains unknown, police have said Kiplagat had been  “waylaid” by the two men before he hit their motorcycle with his car.
Chemweno said the family believes Kiplagat, who leaves behind an expectant wife and a 13-year-old daughter, was not specifically targeted but fell victim to thieves.

AUCKLAND: Rising star Arthur Fils beat fellow Frenchman Richard Gasquet at the Auckland Classic on Tuesday to end the veteran’s run of more than 18 years in the world’s top 100.
The 19-year-old Fils cruised to a 6-3, 6-4 victory against the 37-year-old Gasquet, who had enjoyed a remarkable 956 consecutive weeks in the top 100, peaking at number seven in July 2007.
Gasquet was defending the Auckland title and points he won 12 months ago, so the first-round defeat will see him slide down from 76th in the world when new rankings are released next week.
Fils, with a booming serve that produced nine aces, broke at 2-2 in the first set and at 1-1 in the second and applauded Gasquet as he left the court.
“He’s a great champion. He did an unbelievable career so I’m really happy to play on the court with him,” said Fils, who reached the quarter-finals of the Hong Kong Open last week. But it was a nice match for my part and I’m really happy.”
In other action on Tuesday, Canada’s Denis Shapovalov looked rusty in his first match since Wimbledon last year, losing Austria’s Sebastian Ofner 6-4, 6-2.
Roberto Bautista Agut was beaten by fellow Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena 6-4, 6-4 and eighth seed Max Purcell of Australia overcame New Zealand’s 716th-ranked wildcard Kiranpal Pannu 6-4, 6-4.
The top four seeds, Ben Shelton, Cameron Norrie, Francisco Cerundolo and Felix Auger-Aliassime, all had first-round byes.

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold has picked up a knee injury that will keep him out for a few weeks, assistant manager Pepijn Lijnders said on Tuesday.
The 25-year-old England international, who has made 18 Premier League appearances for Liverpool this season, suffered the injury during Sunday’s 2-0 FA Cup third-round win at Arsenal.
“Trent hyperextended his knee. So he has a little tear in the lateral ligament of his knee and he will need time to recover,” Lijnders said. “Hopefully three weeks, with the winter break in-between,” he told reporters.
Liverpool have a gap of 11 days between Wedne­sday’s League Cup semi-final against Fulham and their next league game at Bournemouth.

WIGAN: Manchester United’s Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes, with a penalty, secured a 2-0 win at Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup fourth round on a bitterly cold night at DW Stadium on Monday.
The victory over the third-tier side was a welcome relief for the 12-time FA Cup winners, who are out of Europe and the League Cup and languishing eighth in the Premier League.
“The FA Cup is all about winning, it is knockout. You want to finish the job. That is what I said in the dressing room ‘job done’,” United manager Erik ten Hag told ITV.
This competition represents United’s final shot at silverware this season and could prove a lifeline for Ten Hag, whose side comfortably avoided an eighth defeat in 14 away matches in all competitions since last season’s FA Cup final, which they lost to neighbours Manchester City.
Dalot scored in the 22nd minute at Wigan when Marcus Rashford had a shot blocked before laying the ball off to the Portuguese, who took a touch before finding the bottom corner of the net from just outside the 18-yard box.
Fernandes doubled United’s lead in the 74th with a penalty after Liam Shaw caught the captain’s foot in the box.
United also wasted a bucket load of chances. Ten Hag’s side had 33 shots, 14 on target, compared to Wigan’s nine. Rashford had eight attempts, four on target.
“Oh, definitely [we should have scored more],” Ten Hag said. “In the first half I think we created five or six very good chances. I think it was very good football. We should have taken more, but if you don’t score you have to stay focused and I think we did that tonight.”
The Red Devils were also handed a favourable fourth round draw against the winners of the third round replay between League Two (fourth tier) Newport County and National League (fifth tier) Eastleigh F.C.
Holders City face a tricky trip to Tottenham Hotspur, while in-form Aston Villa have been drawn to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.
Third-placed champions City are a point above Spurs with a game in hand in the Premier League table, while Villa are flying high in second spot with Chelsea languishing 10th.
Premier League leaders Liverpool will host Norwich City or Bristol Rovers after beating Arsenal 2-0 in the pick of the third round ties.
Fulham welcome Newcastle United and Sheffield United host Brighton & Hove Albion in other all-Premier League ties, with matches scheduled to be played over the Jan. 27-28 weekend.
Sixth-tier Maidstone United, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, travel to second-tier Ipswich Town. The winners of the replay between Crystal Palace and Everton will host either Luton Town or Bolton Wanderers.
League Two side Wrexham A.F.C., owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney and who reached the fourth round last season, will visit Blackburn Rovers.

AUCKLAND: New Zealand opening batter Devon Conway believes his side’s familiarity with touring Pakistan will hold them in good stead when the five-match Twenty20 International series begins from Friday. 
The Black Caps toured Pakistan in April last year, the five-match series ending in a 2-2 draw and Conway said his side has an idea on how their opponents “approach the game”. 
“We have played a lot of cricket against Pakistan, particularly in white-ball cricket,” Conway said in a video shared by New Zealand Cricket on Tuesday. “They’re a very skillful unit with bat and ball. They’ve got some really quality fast bowling and some quality batters up front. 
“So, for us, we’ve got a good idea as to how they approach things, and it’s always a good challenge playing against Pakistan specifically in white-ball cricket.” 
The series opener will be held in Eden Park with the next game to be played in Hamilton’s Seddon Park. The University Oval in Dunedin is the venue for the third game with the last two matches of the series being played at Christchurch’s Hagley Oval. 
“It’s always exciting … I think the opening game at Eden Park is very exciting,” said Conway. “We generally get a really good crowd there, and the atmosphere is electric at Eden Park. It’s a great opportunity for us to travel up and down the country, play at different venues, and play in front of our home fans. So, we’re looking forward to it.” 
Pakistan, led by newly-appointed captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, held their first training session of the tour at Eden Park on Tuesday with fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Zaman Khan and spinner Usama Mir joining the squad after their commitments in Australia’s Big Bash League.
Shaheen, former skipper Babar Azam, wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan, top-oder batter Saim Ayub and all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz also travelled from Australia after featuring in the three-match Test series which Pakistan lost 3-0 to the hosts. 
Other members of the squad, including opener Fakhar Zaman, travelled from Pakistan after a preparatory camp in Lahore with the team holding a three-hour practice session.
Slinger Zaman was seen bowling at full tilt in the nets. He impressed in the BBL once again, bowling searing yorkers against Glenn Maxwell. 
Zaman bowled out Maxwell with one of his yorkers, which became one of the moments of the match between Sydney Thunder and Melbourne Stars.
One of the videos of the session posted on platform X, formerly Twitter, showed Shaheen hitting a no-look shot. 
There were also hints dropped that Pakistan could have a new opening pair of Saim and Rizwan, who faced facers Shaheen, Haris and Zaman.  
Babar, who used to open with recently-named vice-captain Rizwan, was seen facing spinners. 
Conway, who had been featuring in the Super Smash — New Zealand’s domestic T20 competition, said it was nice to link up with the national team again. He had sat out the recent three-match T20 series against Bangladesh which ended in a 1-1 draw. 
“It’s always nice to see the guys again, and yeah, looking forward to spending some time with the group,” he said. “Yeah, it’s been great to have a nice break. 
“Grateful to NZC for allowing me the opportunity to have this break, but yeah, certainly very exciting coming into T20 cricket. It brings that exciting factor, so yeah, looking forward to the series coming up. 
“There’s a lot of cricket coming up, and as a player, you want to play as much as you can. There’s a good mixture of T20 cricket and Test Cricket against quality teams. So, you know, there’s not more you can ask for as a player.” 
Conway was also looking forward to opening the batting with the explosive Finn Allen. 
“It’s been great to see how Finn’s been going,” he said. “He’s a very dynamic, exciting player to watch, and he’s been doing really well in the Super Smash. He’s a great guy to open the batting with because he’s very powerful and makes your role quite easy to get him on strike.

• Rawalpindi police arrest Imran over GHQ attack, sent on two-day remand in May 9 cases
• Accountability court dismisses his bail in Toshakhana, Al-Qadir Trust cases
• Former PM says he is being punished for ‘reining in powerful quarters’
ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested by Ra­w­a­lpindi police in at least a dozen cases pertaining to the May 9 violence, including the attack on the Gene­ral Headqua­rters (GHQ), as an accountability court in Islamabad ind­icted him and former first lady Bus­hra Bibi in the Toshakhana reference on Tuesday.
As per the charge sheet, the former PTI chairman retained 58 out of 108 gifts received from different heads of states during his tenure as the premier. The court charged Mr Khan with securing these gifts at ‘throwaway’ prices.
The judge adjourned further proceedings till Jan 11 in the Toshakhana reference and summoned 12 witnesses on the same date. It alleged that Bushra Bibi kept the exquisite and expensive jewellery set bypassing Toshakhana rules. The military secretary, however, had reported this gift in 2020.
 
 

As per the list of the prosecution, two senior army officers, including the ex-military secretary to the former premier, will testify in this case, whereas private appraiser Sohaib Abbasi has also become an approver against Mr Khan.
Witnesses named by the prosecution included Mr Khan’s ex-military secretary Brig Muhammad Ahmed, Deputy Military Secretary Colonel Rehan Mehmood, Toshakhana section officers Benaymin, Nida Rehman, NAB Addi­ti­onal Director Qaiser Mehmood, State Bank of Pakistan Joint Director Sajid Khan, Assistant Secretary Protocol Zahid Sarfraz Azam, Principal Appraiser Azeem Man­zoor, Appraiser Rabia Samad, Deputy Consulate General at Dubai Rahi­mullah, Counselor Att­ache Irfan Rafaqat, Moh­sin Habib Admin Assistant at the Dubai Consulate, former private secretary Syed Inamullah Shah, Magistrate Mohammad Abdullah, NAB officials Mohsin Haroon, Mustansar Imam Shah, and Hasnain Mustafa.
Talking to the media at Adiala Jail, Mr Khan said that he was being victimised for “reining in the powerful quarters”. He said that the witnesses against him included an office boy. In response to a question about PTI’s support for Sheikh Rashid, Mr Khan said that the party would make a decision soon.
On the other hand, the Rawalpindi Police arre­sted Imran Khan in connection with the May 9 protests. The anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawal­pindi granted a two-day phy­sical remand of Mr Khan and directed the pol­ice to investigate him at Adiala Jail.
Dismissal of bail plea
Accountability judge Mohammad Bashir on Tuesday dismissed the petitions of Mr Khan seeking post-arrest bail in the Toshakhana reference and Al-Qadir Trust case involving 190 million pounds. Likewise, the court adjourned proceedings in 190m pounds corruption case till Jan 17. Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi are likely to be indicted in this case on the said date.
In a related development, the written order of the same court regarding the attachment of the properties of property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son Ahmed Ali Riaz and other accused has been issued.
As per the court order, Malik Riaz’s six properties in Revenue Estate Kotha Kalan and Bimia Kanet in Rawalpindi and 11 bank accounts in Rawalpindi and Islamabad were attached.
‘Imran authored article’
Meanwhile, the PTI has issued a clarification regarding coverage of Mr Khan’s media talk regarding an essay published in The Economist. The spokesman stated that “the said piece has been authored by the PTI chairman-for-life” and “in no way, this has been compiled through the use of artificial means including artificial intelligence”.

• Despite Nawaz’s clearance from all cases, party yet to embark on campaign trail
• Leaders ‘more concerned’ with securing tickets; move to accommodate IPP leaders ‘divides’ Sharif camp
LAHORE: With less than a month to go for the general election, PML-N is yet to kick-start its campaign as it is still sorting out ticket distribution and seat adjustment with the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and PML-Q.
The party appears to be in no rush regarding the launch of its election campaign, and the confidence is apparently due to their “good equation” with the powers that be.
For now, the party’s only concern appears to be getting its candidates right for the national and provincial assemblies’ seats, especially in Punjab.
This is in stark contrast with the charged campaign by the PML-N’s erstwhile ally, the PPP, whose Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari remained in Lahore last week, openly campaigning in the city’s NA-127 constituency and calling out the Sharifs almost daily.
Unperturbed by this, the PML-N leadership, for now, is apparently co­n­tent with ‘public addresses’ in indoor party meetings and media statements.
“Either the leadership knows that the polls are not taking place on Feb 8, or it is confident that only a couple of weeks will be enough for canvassing to emerge as the majority party,” a PML-N leader from Punjab told Dawn on Monday.
He also said that party leaders were less concerned about the election campaign and more preoccupied with securing their tickets.
“The party is likely to announce tickets for the National and Punjab ass­e­mblies in a couple of days. Perhaps after that, it may think about kicking off the election campaign.”
 
 

The leader expressed hope that the party will enter the campaign mode with the launch of its manifesto on Jan 15 or 16.
Earlier, PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal had told Dawn the party would kick-start its campaign once the appeals of former premier Nawaz Sharif were decided.
However, it has been over a month since Mr Sharif’s acquittal in Avenfield and Al-Azizia cases, but the party has yet to launch a concerted push towards electioneering.
The Supreme Court’s verdict of Monday, thro­w­ing out lifetime disqualification for lawma­kers under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, has also effectively rendered the PML-N supremo free to contest the elections.
When contacted on Monday, Mr Iqbal did not comment on the delay in his party’s election campaign.
Ticket dilemma
The party’s seat adjustment with the IPP, in particular, has exacerbated its predicament regarding the distribution of tickets.
 
 

The party is “compelled” to accommodate key candidates of IPP, and ticket distribution in this way is likely to create resentment among PML-N loyalists, as well as IPP ranks, especially in Punjab.
A source in the IPP said that the party’s president, Aleem Khan, had requested the Sharifs to ask Maryam Nawaz Sharif to vacate the NA-119 seat in Lahore for him as he had already launched his campaign from there. “However, Ms Sharif told the leadership to adjust the IPP leader in NA-117, as even this would be a favour to him,” the source said.
Similarly, IPP patron-in-chief and sugar baron Jahangir Khan Tareen is keen to contest the National Assembly election from Lodhran, but the Sharifs want him to contest from Multan. Once of the reasons is that they don’t want to provoke the ire of Sadique Baloch, a strong candidate, who has threatened to contest independently if he is not awarded a ticket from Lodhran.
Separately, Awn Chaudhry, once a close confidant of PTI leader Imran Khan and now a central IPP leader, is vying for a National Assembly seat from Lahore. “He may be considered for NA-124 as he is close to Shehbaz Sharif,” sources said.
The PML-N has reportedly told the IPP that it would not accommodate PTI members who joined the party after the May 9 attacks.
“In such a scenario, IPP will get a very limited number of national and Punjab assembly seats,” said the IPP source, adding that the party had earlier sought over 100 seats from PML-N, which in turn had termed it a “non-serious demand”.
On the PML-N’s side, the powerful Khokhar group of Lahore has reportedly managed to secure at least two national and one Punjab assembly seats.
 
 

A big financier of the party, Saiful Malook Khokhar, is also a blue-eyed leader of the party’s chief organiser, Ms Sharif.
The president of PML-N’s Lahore chapter Mr Khokhar has secured National Assembly seats for himself and his brother, Afzal Khokhar.
With a Punjab Assembly seat also secured for his relative Imran Shafi Khokhar, Mr Khokhar is said to be lobbying for the accommodation of his cousin Faisal Khokhar in the PP-168 constituency.
This has resulted in disagreements among the Sharif family, with Ms Nawaz supporting Mr Faisal and her cousin, Hamza Shahbaz, putting his weight behind a party worker, Shabbir Khokhar.
“Even in a parliamentary board meeting, a question was raised whether the leadership is surrendering to the will of the wealthy Khokhars,” a party insider said.
To placate the malcontents, the party has promised candidates who might miss out on tickets that they would be accommodated in the Senate or given tickets for by-polls, the PML-N insider told Dawn.

ISLAMABAD: Global temperatures reached exc­e­ptionally high levels in 2023, as the unprecede­n­ted heat from June on­­wa­rds led 2023 to become the warmest year on record — overtaking the previous warmest year, 2016, by a large margin, according to the 2023 Glo­bal Climate Highlights rep­ort released on Tuesday.
The year-to-year incre­a­se in global average temperature was exceptiona­lly large from 2022 to 2023. It follows a transition from three years of La Nina in 2020–2022 to El Nino conditions in 2023, alth­ough other factors appear to have also played a role.
 






The report says 2023 marked the first time on record that every day within a year has exceeded 1°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial level for that time of year. Nearly half the days were more than 1.5°C warmer than the 1850-1900 level, and two days in November were, for the first time, more than 2°C warmer.
Mauro Facchini, Head of Earth Observation at the Directorate General for Defence Industry and Space, European Commission, commented: “We knew thanks to the work of the Copernicus programme throughout 2023 that we would not receive good news today. But the annual data presented here provides yet more evidence of the increasing impacts of climate change.”
The ‘Copernicus Climate Change Service’ (C3S) monitored several key climate indicators throughout the year, reporting on record-breaking conditions such as the hottest month on record and daily global temperature averages briefly surpassing pre-industrial levels by more than 2C.  Copernicus is a component of the European Union’s space and earth observation programme.
 
 

The evolution of the daily global average temperature shows that 2023 is noteworthy for the occurrence of the highest global temperatures on record, both in absolute terms, during July, and relative to the annual cycle, during November. Almost all days from the beginning of June were the warmest in the ERA5 data record for that particular day of the year.
The rise in air temperature since the mid-1970s has been about twice as large over land than over ice-free ocean, but each surface accounts for about half of the rise in global average air temperature, as the area of the Earth’s surface covered by ocean is much larger than the area covered by land, the annual climate summary shows.
Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the C3S said: “2023 was an exceptional year with climate records tumbling like dominoes. Not only is 2023 the warmest year on record, it is also the first year with all days over 1°C warmer than the pre-industrial period. Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years”.
The distribution of surface air temperature anomalies across the globe in 2023 shows a marked contrast with that of 2022. Almost all land areas experienced above-average temperatures in 2023. Annual temperatures were more than 1°C higher than the 1991-2020 average over much of Europe and North America, and over several other regions.
The flagship report says marine heatwaves were a common occurrence in 2023, affecting regions such as the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the North Pacific, and much of the North Atlantic.
 
 

Greenhouse gas concentrations in 2023 reached the highest levels ever recorded in the atmosphere and carbon dioxide concentrations in 2023 were 2.4 ppm higher than in 2022 and methane concentrations increased by 11 ppb.
Globally, annual economic losses from climate- and weather-related disasters have significantly increased since the 2000s. In low and lower-middle-income countries, 82 per cent of all damage and loss caused by drought concerned the agriculture sector.
Between 2008 and 2018, across least developed countries and lower middle-income countries, 34pc of disaster-related crop and livestock production losses were attributed to drought, followed by 19pc to flooding events, 18pc to severe storms and hurricanes, 9pc to crop pests and animal diseases, 6pc to extreme temperatures, and 1pc to wildfires.

• Barrister Zafar says poll watchdog is ‘record-keeper’, has no power to revoke electoral symbol
• ECP lawyer rejects assertion; claims intra-party elections were ‘pre-decided’
PESHAWAR: A PTI counsel on Tues­day argued before a Peshawar High Court bench that the Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan overstepped its jurisdiction by stripping the party of its electoral symbol ‘bat’ and nullifying its intra-party polls.
“Without the election symbol ‘bat’ the party will turn almost dormant and it cannot even field candidates on 227 seats reserved for women and non-Muslims across the country,” argued the PTI lead counsel Barrister Syed Ali Zafar before the bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali.
After marathon arguments advanced by lawyers representing the PTI and the ECP for almost five hours, the bench adjo­u­rned the hearing till Wednesday morning. 
During the hearing, Barrister Ali Zafar stated that the ECP, through the impugned order, had declared the PTI intra-party polls as void and deprived it of its election symbol ‘bat’. 
He argued that the ECP had no jurisdiction to decide whether the intra-party elections, held on its direction on Dec 2, were according to the party’s constitution or not. He argued that the ECP was like a ‘record-keeper’ and had no power to declare intra-party polls void.
Barrister Zafar contended that the only objection raised by the ECP against the intra-party polls was that the appointment of the party’s chief election commissioner was not in accordance with the mechanism provided in the party’s constitution.
He argued that as per Section 208 (5)of the Elections Act, 2017 if a political party failed to conduct intra-party polls within the given timeframe in their constitution, a show-cause notice should be issued, and if the party fails to comply with the directions of the ECP, then the commission should impose a fine which may extend to Rs200,000 but not less than Rs100,000. He argued that in no case the ECP could declare the intra-party elections of a political party illegal.
Barrister Zafar claimed that none of the petitioners before the ECP, who had challenged the intra-party polls, were members of the PTI and added that they had no legal position to challenge the party’s polls. “By stripping the party of its election symbol the ECP tried to oust it from the election fray,” he argued.
When the bench questioned why he had been insisting on getting ‘bat’ as its election symbol, he replied that the PTI had contested previous polls under the same symbol and masses were attached to it.
PTI Barrister Gohar Ali also requested the bench to decide the matter on Tuesday as the returning officers would allot symbols on Jan 13.
Intra-party polls ‘pre-decided’
ECP’s counsel Sikander Bashir Mohmand argued that the commission was a constitutional body which had been deriving its powers from different constitutional provisions.
He argued that the petition was not maintainable before the high court as this court could not issue an order affecting the entire country.
He argued that everything was pre-decided in the intra-party polls of the party and no one was allowed to take part in it except those who were elected unopposed.
Dispelling the impression that the ECP had targeted only a single party, he that cases of 19 political parties regarding their intra-party polls had still been pending before the commission.
He also pointed out that the plea of the PTI was also pending before the Supreme Court and the same could not be adjudicated simultaneously before the high court.
“The commission has given several relaxations to the petitioners to hold proper intra-party polls and has lastly on Nov 23 given them 20-day time for that purpose,” Mr Sikander pointed out adding that the PTI failed to do so.
He stated that the ECP role was not of a ‘record-keeper’ as the petitioner had said, but had wide powers under the Co­n­stitution as well as the Elections Act.
It may be noted that PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali and six other leaders had filed a joint petition requesting the court to declare the Dec 22 verdict of the ECP as illegal and without jurisdiction.
The case has seen several twists since Dec 22. A single-member bench of Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel had granted interim relief to the PTI and suspended the ECP’s impugned order. However, that relief proved short-lived as another single-member bench of Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan had vacated the said stay order over the review plea of the commission on Jan 3.

• Commission’s report to SC reveals highest number of disappearances reported from KP, then Balochistan
• Claims some missing persons may have been killed in drone attacks, migrated without informing families
ISLAMABAD: Only seven per cent of the production orders for missing people issued by the Co­mmission of Inquiry on Enfor­ced Disappearances have been implemented, a report submitted by the body to the Supreme Court revealed on Tuesday, even though the commission consumes at least Rs2.2 million in monthly salaries alone.
The commission’s report came in response to Jan 3 directions by the top court in which a three-judge bench — consisting of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali — decided to ascertain facts from the commission.
The judges were hearing the case on enforced disappearances on a petition filed by Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan.
 
 

The report said that the Com­m­i­ssion of Inquiry on Enforced Dis­appearances has issued 744 production orders, of which 52 have been implemented by the add­resses. The remaining 692 production orders were yet to be executed by the quarters concerned.
The province-wise details of the cases in which the production orders were issued but not implemented indicate that 503 (73 per cent) out of 692 cases pertains to the Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, “which obviously appeared to be due to decade-long insurgency and war-like situation in the province, coupled with deaths of unknown people in drone attacks and migration to other countries without informing their families”.
The commission also received 182 petitions from the quarter’s concerned request for review of the production orders in these cases.
Earlier, the Supreme Court ordered the commission to collate and submit the names with parentage and addresses of those who went missing, the name and relationship of the person who reported the missing person, the date they went missing, [and] those who were in government in the federation and the concerned province at that time.
 
 

It also directed the commission to report whether the missing person was recovered or not, and if not recovered, detail the measures, if any, taken to find out the whereabouts of the missing person.
“In addition, all those in respect of whom production orders were issued but were not produced, and what was the follow-up by the Commission when its production orders were not complied with,” the court order said.
The commission’s report also disclosed that it has a disposal rate of over 77pc, with 7,781 of the 10,078 missing persons’ cases disposed of.
The commission’s report said that 1,365 out of 1,625 cases have been disposed of from Punjab, whereas 1,624 out of 1,787 cases have been disposed of from Sindh.
Similarly, 2,149 of 3,485 cases have been disposed of in KP, 2,284 out of 2,752 in Balochistan, 306 out of 361 in Islamabad, and 53 cases out of 68 have been disposed of in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
‘Chairman not withdrawing salary’
The report shows that the four members of the Commission of Enquiry on Enforced Disappe­arances have been allocated salaries of over Rs2.9m per month.
However, the Supreme Court was also informed that Javed Iqbal, the commission’s chairman, did not receive his monthly salary of Rs674,000 for five years, as he was also consecutively serving as the head of the National Accountability Bureau thus saving the national exchequer Rs50m.
The other three members of the commission are former judges Justice Zia Pervaiz and Justice Amanullah Khan, and former IGP Muhammad Sharif Virk, who have been drawing monthly salaries of Rs829,000, Rs1.14m and Rs263,326, respectively.
Mr Iqbal was appointed to the commission in September 2011, Mr Pervaiz in July 2021, Mr Khan in December 2023, and Mr Virk in March 2011.

Pakistan People's Party (PPP) co-chairman and former president Asif Ali Zardari has pledged to address the long-standing issues in Balochistan, particularly in the Sui area.
Speaking at an election meeting in Dera Bugti through a video link on Tuesday, Zardari assured the public that, if elected, his party would lay a gas pipeline in the region, providing a solution to one of the pressing concerns.
Former caretaker federal interior minister Sarfaraz Bugti, former Balochistan education minister Naseebullah Marri and other party leaders also addressed PPP supporters in the Baikar area of Dera Bugti district of the province.
"People of Dera Bugti stand for PPP," Sarfaraz Bugti, the former federal minister who recently joined the party said.
During his address, the PPP co-chairman expressed his commitment to resolving various challenges faced by the people of Balochistan.
He emphasised that upon winning the elections, the PPP would form a government dedicated to tackling issues ranging from healthcare to other local concerns.
Zardari highlighted the party's comprehensive manifesto, saying that it was dedicated to alleviating the problems faced by the people of Balochistan.
In addition to the gas pipeline initiative, Zardari announced plans to generate employment opportunities for the local population in the Dera Bugti area of Balochistan.
He further promised to prioritise the concerns about the economic matters in the region.
Noting the importance of fair resource distribution, Asif Zardari assured the people that the PPP would ensure that the benefits from the gas fields in the area would be shared with the local community.
Zardari expressed regret for being unable to attend the meeting in person due to adverse weather conditions and assured party workers that he would visit the region soon.
Later in the day, the former president departed for Islamabad, having travelled from Sukkur earlier in the day via a special aircraft from Jinnah International Airport Terminal.
The election appellate tribunal of the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday accepted the appeal of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Yasmin Rashid and allowed her to contest the upcoming elections against Nawaz Sharif from NA-130 Lahore.
Following today’s deadline for filing appeals against the decisions of the returning officers, election tribunals across the country are hearing pleas against rejections.
The tribunal overturned the decision of the RO and gave the green light to Rashid to contest from the constituency against the PML-N supremo. 
Appeals of Azam Khan Niazi and PTI’s Mian Mehmoodur Rashid from Lahore were also accepted, hence clearing their path to contest in upcoming general polls.
In Islamabad, the election tribunal of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) approved the nomination papers of Nayab Ali, a transgender and human rights activist, and declared her eligible.

PML-N leaders declared eligible
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PLM-N) former member of provincial assembly (MPA) Shaukat Bhatti was cleared by the tribunal to contest the election. Bhatti, who was disqualified by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2018 in a fake degree case, was given the go-ahead by Election Tribunal Judge Justice Mirza Waqas Rauf to contest polls from PP-9 Gujar Khan.
The election tribunals will today announce decisions on all the appeals filed against earlier decisions by ROs. The chief justices of the high courts have constituted larger benches and will receive appeals against plea rejection by the election tribunal from today onwards.
However, any final appeal against the decision of the larger bench will then be entertained in the Supreme Court.
The returning officers will release the new list of candidates tomorrow, January 11.
Aleema Khan, the sister of former prime minister Imran Khan, revealed on Wednesday that her brother had received a message from the then Chief of Army Staff (COAS), General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa, offering a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly to PTI if Imran ended his protest that had commenced after his ouster from the Prime Minister’s Office.
Imran had launched a nationwide protest following his removal in April last year, becoming the only prime minister in the history of Pakistan to be removed via a no-trust vote.
Khan’s party, which governed the country for over three-and-a-half years, had been struggling to stay in power as its allies betrayed and joined hands with the then-opposition parties that had joined forces against the PTI government.
The former PTI chief had claimed that the conspiracy to topple his government was hatched in Pakistan, a contradiction from his earlier stance in which he blamed the United States for his ouster.
“Former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa conspired against an elected government in collaboration with the PDM [Pakistan Democratic Movement] parties when all economic indicators were showing positive trends,” he had said.
After a meeting with Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, Aleema Khan, while talking to the media, said, "Imran Khan conveyed a message to me, stating, 'In August 2022, General Bajwa approached me with an offer that if PTI ceased protests against regime-change, a two-thirds majority for the party will be ensured in the National Assembly'".
According to Aleema Khan, Imran Khan asserted, "Our parents were born in a slave country; we are free, and I will not bow before anyone except God. It is better for us to face death than to accept slavery in a free country".
Aleema Khan further highlighted the challenges faced, stating that every day permission is granted to only three to four journalists in jail.
“There is no open trial [happening in Adiala jail]. The cases against Imran have no weight,” she added.
She further said Imran is entangled in a new case whenever he gets bail in an old case, saying that it was a ploy to keep the former prime minister in prison.
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has urged government authorities to have faith in the judicial system while warning that one day officials of secret agencies and their bosses will be prosecuted for enforced disappearances in the country.
"The prime minister and the interior and defense ministers will have to give an undertaking that forced disappearances will not happen again. You may not do it today, but at one point, even the highest authorities will be prosecuted," IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani said on Wednesday.
The judge was hearing a petition moved by the protestors who are staging a sit-in in Islamabad against enforced disappearances in Balochistan.
Justice Kayani said the state and its institutions do not believe in the rule of law. “The concept of missing persons is unique to our country; other countries do not have such a concept. Everyone is accountable before the law," he said.
He said there is no point in detaining a person for months, if the authorities cannot prove the accusations levelled against him. Agencies, he said, have previously detained many individuals without finding anything against them, yet they were not released as no one wants to take responsibility.
“No individual within an agency holds the authority to make that decision. I believe the highest authorities are responsible for any such actions. The prime minister, defense minister, interior minister, and their secretaries will be accountable; those beneath them won't have any say,” he said.
The judge noted that terrorism would not stop by merely imprisoning people and that there needs to be a trial. There are anti-terrorism courts for holding trials of alleged terrorists. The judge asked why the trial of Baloch militants cannot take place in the ATCs.
“Activate the ATCs for combating terrorism in Balochistan. Trust the system; no one would ever want terrorists to be protected," he said.
During the proceedings, Attorney General for Pakistan Usman Awan stated that lawyer for the petitioners, Imaan Mazari, had provided a list of missing Baloch students.
“Nine missing Baloch students have been recovered, while 15 are still missing. All efforts are being made to recover the remaining missing Baloch students," he said.
The judge noted that no missing Baloch has appeared in the court after his recovery.
“I don't know if the recovered individuals are doing well or not. I'm unaware of the health conditions of those who have been recovered.”
The judge stated that authorities will have to inform the court whether a missing person has been found alive or deceased. The court later adjourned till February 13
 
The report prepared by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances on Tuesday revealed that most people in the country -- 3,485 – went “missing” from the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Around a week ago, the Supreme Court directed the body to submit within 10 days a comprehensive report detailing all its orders issued to law enforcement agencies (LEAs) for the production of missing persons.
In line with the top court’s orders, the body handed over its report to the attorney general for Pakistan. “The province-wise details of the cases in which production orders were issued but not implemented, indicate that 503 (72.68%) out of 692 such cases pertain to the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, which obviously appears to be due to decade long insurgency and warlike situation in the province, coupled with deaths of unknown persons in drone attacks,” the report read.

Apart from other reasons, the report also cited people’s “migration to other countries” without informing their families as one of the causes behind the cases The commission informed the SC that 2,149 cases in K-P had been disposed of leaving a balance of 1,336 -- a success percentage of 61.66% The report further revealed that after K-P, the highest number of ‘enforced disappearances’ was reported in Balochistan -- 2,752.
However, the body maintained that it had addressed 2,284 of these cases, leaving only 468 unresolved as it claimed to achieve a success rate of 82.99% in the province. After Balochistan, the report claimed that the highest number of missing people was reported in Sindh – 1,787. It continued that it had disposed of 1,624 of them and 163 remained unresolved   boasting a success rate of 90.87%. The body claimed that it had disposed of 1,365 cases out of 1,625 in Punjab – with a success rate of 84% as only 260 remained unresolved.

In the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), the body stated that it had addressed 306 cases out of 361 leaving a balance of 55. The report cited the body’s success percentage in ICT at 84.76%. The commission claimed in its report that it had addressed 53 of 68 cases reported in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) leaving a balance of 15 unresolved ones. It maintained that it had achieved a success rate of 77.94% in AJK.
The body informed the SC in its report that it had issued a total of 744 production orders. “Out of which, 52 have been implemented by the addresses, while the remaining 692 production orders are yet to the executed by the quarters concerned,” it added. The body continued that it had received 182 petitions from the quarters concerned requesting for a review of the production orders in these cases.
Seat adjustment between the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has been decided in many national and provincial assembly constituencies across the province, including three constituencies in Karachi. However, no consensus could be reached on NA-242 constituency of Karachi.
The committees of MQM-P and PML-N held their seventh meeting regarding seat adjustment in Sindh and the seat adjustment was successful on three seats, while the MQM-P made its withdrawal conditional on NA-242 constituency of Kemari district.
Sources said the PML-N will field its candidates from NA-229 and NA-230 in Malir and provincial assembly seats from the area while the MQM-P agreed to support them.

It was agreed that the MQM would field its candidate from NA-231 in Malir and the provincial assembly seats.
The PML-N will field its candidate from NA-239 constituency of Karachi’s District South under the seat adjustment.
Apart from this, PML-N will field its candidates for the National Assembly seats from Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah and Sukkur. While the MQM candidates would contest on the provincial assembly seats.
Both the committees could not decide on the seat adjustment for NA-242 in Kemari district, from where strong candidates like former premier Shehbaz Sharif and former Karachi Nazim Mustafa Kamal have filed their nomination papers.
Imran Khan, the former prime minister and PTI founder currently detained at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, claimed that he is being penalized for holding the powerful accountable under the rule of law.
"In a society that claims to follow Islamic principles, is 'Amr Bil Maroof' upheld?" Imran queried during an informal interaction with journalists inside a courtroom at Adiala Jail after a hearing related to the Toshakhana case. 'Amr Bil Maroof' is a Quranic directive that translates to "enjoining the good."
Addressing the specifics of the case, he countered the National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) assertion that he utilized his office boy as a front-man for engaging in corruption valued at billions of rupees. "Can a prime minister feasibly involve a peon in corrupt practices?" he questioned.
Imran Khan emphasized that a society's vitality lies in its adherence to goodness. "When goodness diminishes, so does the society," he affirmed.
The PTI founder refrained from commenting on the Supreme Court's January 8 decision that cleared the path for his arch-rival, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, to participate in the forthcoming elections.
PML-N leader Javed Latif on Tuesday called for more aggressive actions against former prime minister Imran Khan, demanding booking of him on several charges while also urging his conviction regarding the May 9 incident.
Addressing a news conference, the PML-N leader termed the Supreme Court’s decision of overturning lifetime disqualification a first step towards a level-playing field.
Latif, a minister without portfolio in the outgoing PDM government, asserted that Imran Khan still enjoyed support, shielding him from conviction in the May 9 incident. He called for intensified measures against the incarcerated former prime minister for threatening the judiciary, ECP, and state institutions.
Moreover, he regretted remarks given by the caretaker prime minister – who was single-handedly picked by his party – regarding the May 9 incidents.
He added that the premier’s uncertainty regarding Imran Khan's involvement in the riots was beyond comprehension, particularly given his time in power for several months.
He highlighted that the absence of any application from the ECP against Imran Khan served as proof of the latter's ongoing support.
Expressing regret, he noted the “lack of comprehensive media coverage” regarding Imran Khan's alleged threats to an ECP official while in jail.
He further accused the media of inadequately highlighting the significance of the cypher issue, asserting that Imran Khan's survival in that case was yet another instance of the support he enjoys.
He pointed out the presence of powerful figures exerting pressure on the judiciary to avoid convictions, questioning why there had been no conviction in the cypher case despite seven months having elapsed.
“Is it not a weakness of our institutions?”

The former federal minister asked whether Pakistan was a ‘slum’ with no rule of law where the former PTI chief rules as a gang leader operating with impunity, freely abusing and threatening individuals while expecting courts to comply with his whimsical demands.
He urged the judiciary to swiftly deliver a verdict on the May 9 incident.
Stressing a clear distinction between other political leaders and Imran Khan, he said that the latter was not a political figure but rather a thug.
He said it was being alleged that international forces conspired against Imran. “Why would they, what did he do for Pakistan?” he asked. “Why would international forces, that want to destabilise a Pakistan, conspire against a person, who did nothing for his country?”
Surprisingly, despite the recent series of reliefs granted to PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and his party, Javed Latif commented that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Nawaz Sharif's lifetime disqualification was merely an initial stride toward establishing a fair ground for competition.
He expressed that a truly level playing field would entail further decisions to rectify injustices previously imposed on them.
During his interaction with the media, a journalist later asked Javed about his definition of a level playing field and whether it meant arresting his adversaries and hanging them all.
However, in response, Javed dismissed both the question and the line of inquiry, reiterating his stance that if May 9 constituted a crime, the perpetrators ought to face appropriate punishment.
He also took jibe at Bilawal Bhutto stating that a person whose father does not take him seriously is not worth talking about.
Furthermore, he said that announcing ten points during a speech that revolved around giving handouts was not a manifesto.  “Such speeches are made by political leaders in every rally. A manifesto should mean a pragmatic road map for a political party to act on when in power.”
Javed said that he was against any seat adjustment in Punjab, as the first right to contest should be of those who have stood by the party in thick and thin.
He also announced that party leadership would be announcing its rally schedule in a day or two.
Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, while acknowledging that Pakistan and Africa had enjoyed excellent political relations over the years, on Tuesday stressed the need to enhance trade and economic linkages which were yet to realise their full potential.
He also highlighted the importance Pakistan attached to Africa and expressed the desire to strengthen ties with African countries, at the bilateral as well as regional level.
The prime minister met a group of resident envoys representing African countries as well as a select Asian countries over lunch, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The meeting was attended by the ambassadors of Algeria and Sudan as well as High Commissioners of Bangladesh, Brunei, Malaysia, Mauritius, and South Africa. Other participants included the Charges d’Affaires of Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe.
The caretaker prime minster mentioned that the 4th Pakistan-Africa Trade Conference was underway in Cairo, Egypt from January 9-11 where Pakistan was represented by a large business delegation led by the commerce minister.
PM Kakar also expressed deep appreciation for Pakistan’s historic ties with the Southeast Asian countries, particularly Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia.

He said Pakistan was keen to expand bilateral trade ties with the key countries and sought their assistance in strengthening its engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
Referring to the ongoing situation in Gaza, the prime minister stressed the need for dialogue among nations and for intensifying collective efforts to end the violence and bring lasting peace in Palestine.
He also praised the diplomatic envoys for their efforts to build stronger ties with Pakistan and their respective countries.
PIA privatisation
The prime minister directed the authorities concerned to pace up the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
In a meeting with his Adviser on Aviation Air Marshal (retd) Farhat Hussain, the prime minister emphasised ensuring transparency in the process of privatisation.
PM Kakar said privatization of state-owned enterprises was on priority for the government to save the national exchequer from further financial losses.
He said the country’s aviation industry had a high scope of growth through investment.
The prime minister also directed the out-sourcing of airport operations in a bid to ensure improvement of services.
The aviation adviser briefed PM Kakar about the matters of the ministry and the reform process. 
KARACHI: Three independent candidates, said to be associated with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London, were picked up by law enforcement agencies in raids on their homes in district East, the party and family said.
However, the area police expressed ignorance about the raids and subsequent arrests.
Videos widely shared on social media showed a number of policemen surrounding the houses of Nisar Panwhar and his son Mohsin and Advocate Jauhar Abid in Saadi Town and Gulshan-i-Iqbal, respectively, and then taking them away.
The trio had filed nomination papers for contesting the Feb 8 general election as independent candidates but the returning officers concerned rejected them. They approached election tribunals which allowed them to contest the polls.
In a statement, the coordination committee of the MQM-L claimed that they were arrested only to stop them from contesting the elections.
The party urged the chief justice of Pakistan and chief election commissioner to take notice of the ‘arrests’ and ensure their immediate release.
It questioned as to what kind of level-playing field was provided by the election authorities when independent candidates were being picked up just to prevent them from contesting the polls.
Meanwhile, Gulshan SP Farhat Kamal said the police did not arrest Advocate Abid. 
Dawn approached SSP-East Irfan Bahadur for his version, but he did not respond.
Only on Monday, the nomination papers of Nisar Panwhar and Advocate Abid were accepted from NA-231 and NA-248 constituencies by an election tribunal.

• Orders demolition of multi-storey building near Star Gate
• Seeks details of all illegal structures in Karachi
• Reviews steps for beautification of Sharea Faisal          
KARACHI: Expressing grave concern and displeasure over the construction of illegal buildings along Sharea Faisal and other areas of Karachi, caretaker Chief Minister retired Justice Maqbool Baqar has directed the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) to immediately demolish such structures across the city and take stern action against officials who approved the layout plans of such constructions or deliberately ignored them.
The city has transformed into a concrete jungle, mainly due to excessive commercialisation and poor planning as the number of illegally-raised building has been increasing with each passing year, with officials of SBCA actively conniving with the builders. Despite the Sindh High Court’s frequently taking exception to the mushroom growth of illegal and unauthorised construction in the city, the issue remains unchanged.
Chairing a follow-up meeting regarding the beautification of the Sharea Faisal and restoration of Chaukhandi Graveyard, the chief minister pointed out to a multi-storey building being constructed near Star Gate and ordered its immediate demolition as it was found extended out near the main road.
Informed sources said that the chief minister expressed annoyance over the construction of illegal buildings in the city, including those along the city’s main artery, and directed SBCA chief Ishaq Khuhro to submit within 15 days a detailed report on the construction of such buildings across the city.
The sources said that the SBCA chief was asked to give details of buildings so far demolished since the establishment of caretaker set up in the province.
They said that he was also asked to give in his report the details of the permissions granted for building construction during the caretaker government.
A statement from the CM House said that the meeting was attended, among others, by Sports & Antiquities Minister Dr Junaid Shah, Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh, Forest Secretary Najam Shah, Culture Secretary Khalid Chachar, Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Rajput, Architects Ali Naqvi and Ms Komal Pervez and Consultant Dr Kaleem Lashari.
It said that the CM pointed out that a building opposite Star Gate was being built but encroached on the service road. He directed the SBCA chief to bulldoze the building and take strict action against the officer responsible for the illegal construction.
As for the beautification of the Sharea Faisal, the commissioner informed the CM that a wall had been erected in front of Falaknaz Apartments, adding that the wall would be beautified with stone carving work and tiles showing different cultural colours of Sindh.
A spot was identified at the corner of the road going to Jinnah Terminal for which the CM decided that the KMC would develop a park there.
The CM also decided that the underpass at Drigh Road would also be beautified with lights, paints and installation of different tiles.
It was decided that the two flyovers located on the Sharea Faisal would also be beautified with tiles, paints and greenery. Sitting areas would be developed under the flyovers/bridges.
Mayor Murtaza Wahab told the CM that the green belt of Sharea Faisal was being beautified with plantation of trees and seasonal flowers, and that beautiful grills would also be installed there.
The chief minister directed DG SBCA to urgently move the builder of the Falaknaz Apartments to repair and renovate his buildings and treat their seepage.
Since its induction, the caretaker provincial government has attempted to control the menace but to no avail as the mechanism of corruption for granting permissions for building construction, commonly known as ‘system’, is still reported to be operative in the SBCA.
Even caretaker Local Government Minister Mubin Jumani during his introductory meeting with LG department had said that the city had been turned into a jungle of concrete, directing the SBCA chief to independently initiate immediate action against all ‘systems’ including ‘illegal construction system’.
Chaukhandi Graveyard
The CM was given detailed presentations on the progress made so far in the restoration of the Chaukhandi Graveyard by the commissioner, architects and the secretaries of culture and forest departments.
The commissioner told the CM that the trucks/containers parked along the access road had been removed and the cleanliness of the graveyard and its surrounding areas was in progress.
The forest secretary told the CM that the social forestry division had been assigned the task of conserving the graveyard. He pointed out that 800 different species of plants, shrubs and trees existed in the graveyard. They include Imli, Mango, Zaitoon, suhanjha, badam, Anjeer, Beri and others.
The CM was told that the forest department would plant 50,000 trees at the graveyard, including 5,000 neem, 13,000 of Gulmohar, 500 peepals, 4,000 Imli and others.
It was pointed out that plantation was the best way to prevent the archaeological site from erosion and exposure to weather.
Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that the KMC would develop a park at Chaukhandi Graveyard so that visitors could enjoy a proper sitting place.
Architect Ms Komal also gave a presentation about the master plan and landscape of the site and told the CM that she had submitted the master plan to the culture department.
The technical team of the project informed the CM that they had completed the documentation and survey of graves and canopies. They pointed out that 225 graves were in good condition, 275 were partially damaged and 199 were in dilapidated condition.
The chief minister desired that the design, features, financial implications, and hiring of artisans be finalised and carried out by the culture department.

• Tribunal allows two sons of Fehmida Mirza to contest polls
• SHC dismisses petition against candidature of PTI’s Firdous Naqvi        


Shehbaz Sharif

 
KARACHI: An election tribunal on Tuesday dismissed another appeal against acceptance of the nomination papers of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president Shehbaz Sharif and allowed him to contest the Feb 8 election from a Karachi National Assembly constituency (NA-242 Keamari-I).
The tribunal, headed by Justice Arshad Hussain Khan of the Sindh High Court, rejected the election appeal filed by a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf candidate after hearing parties concerned and upheld the decision of the returning officer (RO).
Citing the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), district returning officer (DRO), RO and Mr Sharif as respondents, Mr Chohan submitted that he had filed objections against the nomination papers of PML-N president, but the RO did not give any heed to them.
The appellant contended that Mr Sharif had submitted his nomination paper on Dec 22, 2023 in which he allegedly concealed several facts, showed incorrect assets details, etc.
The appellant submitted that the impugned order was passed by the RO in a hasty manner without considering his objections.
Alleging that the PML-N president could not be considered as ‘sadiq and ameen’ in terms of Article 62 of the Constitution due to misdeclaration, he pleaded to set aside the order of the RO and reject the nomination papers of Mr Sharif.
However, the tribunal dismissed his appeal and maintained the RO’s order.
On Monday, another election tribunal had dismissed an appeal filed by a Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate against acceptance of nomination papers of the former prime minister.
Fehmida’s sons allowed to contest polls
The same tribunal on Tuesday allowed the appeals of Hasnain Mirza and Hassam Mirza, sons of Dr Fehmida and Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, against rejection of their nomination papers from PS-70 (Badin-III) and NA-223 (Badin-II), respectively.
On Monday, an election tribunal had dismissed the appeals of their parents and maintained the decision of the ROs who had rejected the couple’s nomination papers from NA-223, PS-70, PS-71 and PS-72.
The tribunal also turned down an appeal filed against the candidature of former provincial minister and PPP leader Saeed Ghani.
Appellant Arsalan Khan, said to be a voter of the PS-105, filed the appeal after the RO had accepted the nomination papers of the PPP leader.
Petition of MQM-P candidate dismissed
The SHC on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed against the candidature of PTI leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi.
Initially, the RO had dismissed the nomination papers of Mr Naqvi from NA-236 (Karachi East-II) after his rival candidate filed objections. On Jan 4, an election tribunal had allowed the appeal of the PTI leader and overturned the decision of RO.
However, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s candidate Hassan Sabir, who had submitted objections before the RO, filed a petition against the order of the election tribunal.
After hearing arguments from both sides, a two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudary dismissed the petition.
Meanwhile, the same bench on Tuesday allowed another PTI candidate to contest the Feb 8 general elections.
Dr Masroor Sial filed two petitions against the decisions of the election tribunal for rejecting his appeals against the orders of the ROs.
The ROs had rejected his papers from NA- 230 (Malir-I) and NA-231 (Malir-II) and subsequently, the tribunal had also turned down his appeals.
The division bench allowed both the petitions and overturned the orders of tribunals.

KARACHI: Two of the six air passengers, who were found to have Covid during screening at the Jinnah International Airport, have tested positive for JN.1 variant, currently a cause of concern in several countries.
The passengers, one of them a resident of Kech in Balochistan, and the other of Qasimabad in Hyderabad, had arrived in Karachi from Abu Dhabi and Bangkok, respectively. 
Their samples for genome sequencing had been sent to a lab of the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) after they tested positive for Covid at the airport. 
“We are in contact with the passengers. Their condition is stable,” a health department spokesperson said, adding that the families had been advised to get themselves tested for Covid.
“The airport authorities have been asked to resume the public service announcement system on Covid so that passengers start wearing masks and ensure physical distancing and hand hygiene to reduce the infection risk during travel.”

Sindh health dept issues advisory, calls for taking preventive measures against new variant 

Meanwhile, the health department has released an advisory, directing district health officials and medical superintendents across the province to identify and notify individuals who have been in close contact with the confirmed cases and ensure proper treatment to the patients.
The directives also included the establishment of a Covid ward at the district and taluka hospitals and providing the facility for vaccination against the disease.
It might be recalled that six air passengers have so far been tested positive for the new Covid variant in the country. Four of the patients, according to the federal health ministry, have recovered.
According to experts, the JN.1 variant, also called a sub-variant of the Omicron lineage, is more transmissible than other circulating variants, and the proportion of cases caused by this particular virus has been rising.

Mr Sher, who worked with a private firm as an accountant, died on the spot, Sharifabad SHO Jameel Rehman said, adding that the killers did not take away anything from the victim.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for a post-mortem examination.

KARACHI: The final-year thesis show of the students at the Arts Council of Pakistan’s Institute of Arts and Crafts constitutes of striking artworks made by the young boys and girls belonging to the departments of fine art, textile design, graphic design and communication design. 
Paintings and sculptures (in the fine art category) are on view at the Ahmed Pervez Gallery while works representing the other two categories are placed in Haseena Moin Hall. 
It is such a delight to see the young artists — 31 in total out of which three have speech and hearing impairments — expressing themselves with the kind of abandon that’s essential to grow as creative souls. 
It has to be said that in no time, the institute has managed to come out with artists who, for sure, have a bright future in a field in which Pakistan has already, in recent times, made its presence felt on a global scale. 
Since it is difficult to point out individuals due to the large number of works on view, in general, one is impressed with the way the participating youngsters have used a considerable variety of media to put across an equally wide range of ideas.
Inaugurating the exhibition, writer Anwar Maqsood, who himself is a top-notch painter, said, “After a long time I have seen such good work. This [council’s] building needs to be celebrated because here all sorts of art-related activities — dance, music, painting etc — can take place.” 
Caretaker Information Minister and Arts Council president Ahmed Shah said, “In the last one or two years, the Arts Council has produced a big number of young artists, a feat that not even reputed [art] institutes have been able to achieve. We are going to begin masters’ course for the students in order for them to move ahead in terms of innovation and creativity.” 
The show concludes on Wednesday (today).

KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Tuesday indicted Sindh president of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Haleem Adil Sheikh in a rioting case.
The court read out the charges to which Mr Sheikh pleaded not guilty and opted to contest the case. The court summoned prosecution witnesses and adjourned the hearing till Jan 17.
Mr Sheikh, along with three identified and 150 unidentified party activists, was booked for allegedly holding a violent protest on the M-9 motorway in March 2023 in protest over a police siege of PTI chairman Imran Khan’s Lahore residence.
The case was registered at the Sachal police station under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offense committed on prosecution of a common object), 427 (mischief causing damage), and 186 (obstructing a public servant in the discharge of public functions) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

Five remanded in JI worker murder case
A judicial magistrate remanded five suspects in physical custody in a case pertaining to the killing of a Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) worker in Orangi Town.
The investigating officer (IO) of the case produced the suspects —Zafar Akram, Shaikh Majiid, Ahad Raza, Muhammad Waseem and Muhammad Shahzeb — before Judicial Magistrate (West) Ali Imran Shah on Tuesday.
The magistrate remanded all the suspects to physical custody for three days and directed the IO to submit a progress report along with the suspects on the next hearing scheduled for Jan 12.
During the hearing, the IO submitted an application before the court to record the statements of the prosecution witnesses under Section 164 CrPC. The court rejected the request because the IO failed to satisfy the court and also both witnesses had already recorded their statements under Section 161 CrPC, supporting the version of the FIR.
Wasim Siddiqui (JI worker) was gunned down by armed assailants near Jamaatul Mursaleen Masjid, Orangi Town on Jan 2.
According to police, they have managed to arrest, using technical and human intelligence, three “hired assassins” and two others who gave the contract (supari) of killing.
The police identified the victim’s relatives as Waseem and Shahzeb.
They had given Rs300,000 to Zafar, Majid and Ahad for killing the JI worker over some personal enmity, the spokesperson said in a statement.

NAWABSHAH: Shahjahan Junejo, brother of Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) candidate for NA-209 (Sanghar) Mohammed Khan Junejo, was booked along with 20 people, including five women, on Tuesday for allegedly blocking way to Nizamani House with burning objects with intention to sabotage a planned gathering where two former GDA leaders from the Nizamani community were to announce their joining of Pakistan Peoples Party. 
Senior PPP leader and a former lawmaker Shazia Atta Marri was to visit the Nizamani House to welcome Shahid Khan Nizamani and Farooq Nizamani alias Kako to the PPP fold but, according to her, she could not reach the Nizamani House due to the road blockade. 
The FIR (No.6/24) was registered against the suspects by SHO Sanaullah Panhwar of the Sanghar police station under Sections 341, 353, 147, 148 and 149 of Pakistan Penal Code on behalf of the state.
The SHO stated in the FIR that he was on routine patrolling on Monday night when he received information about a demonstration and road blockade along Pir Saheb Pagaro Road by a crowd. He stated that he came to know that Shahid Nizamani and Farooq Nizamani alias Kako were to announced their quitting of the GDA and joining the PPP for which a programme was arranged at the Nizamani House and certain PPP leaders were about arrive. 
The SHO stated that when reached the troubled spot, he saw some 100 to 150 residents of Nizamani Muhalla, including women and children, having assembled outside the Nizamani House. They were carrying clubs, bricks and stones and had blocked the road and denying free movement to vehicles and pedestrians, he claimed, and added that the demonstrators were shouting that they would not allow any PPP leader or their vehicles to pass through the road.
The SHO further stated that he tried to persuade the demonstrators, who had lit bonfire in the middle of the road, to disperse peacefully and clear the road but in vain. They also stopped police from discharging their official duties, he said.
SHO Panhwar mentioned the name of Shahjahan Junejo and claimed that he was instigating the crowd to keep blocking the road.
Those nominated in the FIR, besides Shahjahan Junejo, are Kashif, Abdul Ghafar, Majid, Dadan Ali, Waryam, Umaid Ali, Ali Raza, Bahadur, Jummo, Ms Mehnaz, Ms Jannat, Ms Azra, Ms Khairi and Ms Razia — all Nizamanis by caste — and Nangar Wassan, Ronjho Khaskheli, Mashooq Khaskheli, Kazim Sehano and Haji Nazir Hussain.
The SHO said that the matter was brought to the knowledge of police high-ups after which reinforcement was called out to restore law and order and clear the road.
No one could be arrested as all demonstrators escaped into narrow lanes as soon as the police moved against them, the police officer stated.
PPP leaders condemn incident
Shazia Marri along with Naveed Dero, Aajiz Dhamrah and other PPP leaders spoke to the media on Monday night to condemn the episode. She described the demonstration to block access to the Nizamani House as a shameful act.
She said that such activities were a clear violation of the code of conduct prescribed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
She also criricised the caretaker government failure to ensure an environment conducive to peaceful electioneering and free and fair elections. She observed that the police failed to control a handful of people indulging in the unlawful act.
She urged the ECP to take notice of the pre-planned attempt to disturb the political situation in Sanghar.
She alleged that the assistant returning officers of NA-209, PS-40 and PS-41 were disciples of [GDA leader] Pir Pagara.
‘Deceased woman among booked suspects’
Abdul Ghaffar Nizamani, one of the suspects nominated in the FIR, denied having been among the demonstrators and condemned the police for naming him in the case.  
He maintained that he, being a media worker and social activist, was present there for coverage.
“The police also booked my mother, who had died some five years back,” he said in his video message.
The GDA candidate or his family members could not be reached by phone despite repeated attempts.

HYDERABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) is in serious talks with Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan-Imam Noorani (JUP-I) leader Owais Noorani Siddiqui, son of late Allama Shah Ahmed Noorani, over adjustment on a National Assembly seat in Hyderabad.
PPP has finalised names of its candidates for all constituencies of Hyderabad but NA-220 (Hyderabad city). “The party leadership is talking to Owais Noorani Siddiqui on this seat,” said Sindh PPP information secretary Ajiz Dhamra, who is himself the party’s candidate for PS-64 (Hyderabad city). 
He had lost this seat to MQM-P in 2018 polls.
PPP had withdrawn its candidate, Dr Irfan Gul Magsi, from NA-220 in favour of JUP-Noorani leader Sahibzada Abul Khair Mohammad Zubair in 2018 polls. Zubair had lost to MQM-P. 
“I am holding talks with all parties including PPP for adjustment on seats,” said Noorani over phone. His father had contested general elections from Hyderabad in 1988 and then in 1993 but lost to MQM-P’s Aftab Ahmed Shaikh.
In 2002 general elections late Noorani had nominated Zubair as Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal candidate for the city’s constituency. Zubair had defeated MQM’s Aftab Ahmed Sheikh by a small margin along with MMA’s Abdul Rehman Rajput who also trounced MQM-P’s late Farooq Qureshi on PS-45.
Presently, Noorani and Zubair lead their separate factions of JUP. Jan 12 is last date for withdrawal of candidatures. It was learnt that Noorani had sought adjustments on NA-220 and PS-65 but PPP had finalised the name of Haji Fareed Qureshi for PS-65 and kept its decision pending on NA-220. 
Dr Magsi has applied for this seat again. Noorani believed that recent delimitations might favour him on NA-220.

SUKKUR: The Pak-istan Peoples Party’s senior leader Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah has reassured nation that no party or individual should have doubts about Feb 8 general election and they should know the polls will be held on time across Pakistan.
Shah told participants in a procession organised by his party in Salehpat town on Tuesday that Supreme Court of Pakistan had left no doubt in minds about the polls and given very clear passage that general elections would be definitely held in the country. 
He urged political parties to leave politics of drawing room and take the field for polls. As time had changed now, no one could get himself or herself elected by getting ballot papers stamped for him or her, he said in a sarcastic tone.
He said that wherever they were going for electioneering, they had to inform people of their performance. Dictators too should be asked about their performance of 40 years. “The dictators spent 700 billion dollars during the 40 years. If such huge amount of money had been spent on Pakistani industries, many problems could have been resolved undoubtedly,” he said.
He said that PPP did not do power politics. “Rather, we want powerful government of people which can resolve problems of people and the country,” he said.
Shah said that PPP wanted to bring smiles and lights on peoples’ faces. When the party came to power, it would resolve electricity problem by providing solar plates to people, he said.
He told party workers that PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had promised that minimum wages of the poor would be doubled to at least Rs50,000. Under the party’s rule in the province, 28 water channels had been built, which irrigated 150,000 acres of barren land, he said, adding that more water channels would be built and fortified when the party came to power for five years, he said.
He said that PPP founder gave constitution to the country and refused to leave his land when he was pressured to do so by the martial law regime. Those who defeated death lived forever and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had defeated death, said Shah, adding Bhutto never bowed his head before tyrants.
He said that Benazir Bhutto came back for people despite serious threats to her life and was made to pay the price with her life. They had done a lot but still much had to be done for people, he said and claimed that he had never told lies, nor done hypocrisy or put someone in jails.

THATTA: Speakers at a literature festival organised under the aegis of Sindh University Thatta Campus here on Tuesday highlighted importance of reading books and said quality literature and habit of reading can transform a backward people into a progressive society.
They praised the university’s efforts for promoting literary activities in the historical district of Sindh.
Historian and educationist Dr Abdul Ghafoor Memon said that Thatta had a glorious past in education and being a centre of knowledge but it had now lost contact with the modern world due to unavailability of facilities and youth’s alienation from literature. “Our girls are unaware of the modern methodologies of learning,” he said.
He said the girls should be provided equal opportunities. Quality literature and habit of book reading could transform a backward people into a progressive society, he said. 
Prof Dr Arfana Malah observed that love of literature would inculcate decency in society. It quelled differences between different sections of society. “We have to be more forward looking and put Sindh on the path to constant progress,” she proposed.
“The literary gatherings remind us of the contribution of our heroes to literature. Women in remote areas should come out of their homes so that objective of a progressive society can be achieved,” she said.
Dr Mohammad Ali Manji called for female education and urged authorities concerned to take measures for spreading the message of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai who advanced revolutionary ideas of transforming society.
Renowned writer and poet Engineer Obhayo Khan Khushk also spoke. The festival also featured stalls for books, traditional foods and embroidery. Towards the end of the event, students presented tableaus on different social issues.

ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has warned that the polls may have to be delayed if orders keep coming for changing the election symbols already allocated to candidates.
Without naming any court, the ECP in a statement pointed out that election symbols were being changed through various forums.
 
 

Following the allotment of election symbols, the ECP said it had already ordered the printing of ballot papers to the three printing corporations and the printing work had started a day before.
“If the process of changing the election symbols continues in the same way, there is a fear of election delay, because the ballot papers will have to be reprinted for which time is already limited and on the other hand, the special paper available for the ballot papers will also be lost,” it reasoned.
 







Officials told not to change symbols allocated to candidates; PPP demands removal of ‘biased ROs’

The commission noted over 33 per cent increase in the number of candidates for the upcoming general elections, as a total of 18,059 are in the run as compared to 11,700 candidates who contested the 2018 polls.
In the 2018 elections, 800-tonne paper was used for printing 220 million ballot papers, while this time the estimate is 2,070-tonne paper for printing of 260m ballot papers particularly after the update of electoral rolls in the backdrop of the delimitation of constituencies.
While the ECP is dealing with this situation, it has repeatedly issued instructions to relevant officials that election symbols should not be changed once the printing had started. However, the statement added, it was also being considered that if the trend of changing the election symbols did not stop, there would be no other option but to postpone the elections in such constituencies.
The ECP earlier barred district returning officers (DROs) and returning officers (ROs) from changing election symbols allocated to electoral candidates for the upcoming elections.
 
 

According to ECP spokesman Syed Nadeem Haider, the ECP directed the provincial election commissioners, DROs and ROs to avoid changing election symbols at this stage, and to seek its approval if a change was essentially required.
Denial of symbol
The directive came just a day after the PPP had raised serious concern over denial of the party election symbol (arrow) to its ticket holders in Punjab and placing them in the category of independent candidates.
Senator Taj Haider, official in charge of PPP’s central election cell, in a letter written to the chief election Commissioner had pointed out that under Section 66 of the Elections Act, 2017, “a declaration before the RO about his affiliation with a particular political party, if any, along with a certificate from the political party showing that he is that party’s candidate from that constituency was the only and the final requirement for ‘seeking allotment of a prescribed symbol’”.
“There is no ambiguity in this Section of the Elections Act, 2017 and it should be followed in letter and spirit,” the letter said. “… the whole system of our constitutional democracy is built around the basic structure of political parties. Accepted that citizens have the option of contesting elections as independent candidates but, we have repeatedly experienced that the presence of independents in an elected house does open an unfortunate window for horse trading and exerting pressures on the elected independents,” it read.
The letter said independent candidates were often elected by taking advantage of ‘parochial, racial, tribal, sectarian and provincial prejudices’ fault lines among the citizens.
“Under Article 33 of our constitution, it is the duty of the state to discourage such and similar such prejudices. Instead citizens should be encouraged to vote on the performance, policies and manifestos of political parties. Pushing valid candidates who are affiliated to a party and also submit required documents before ROs at the time of seeking a prescribed symbol, outside the fold of that party and into the category of independents runs contrary to the provisions of Article 33 and the necessary and sufficient requirements of Section 66 of the Elections Act, 2017,” it said.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), named some of the candidates denied the symbol of arrow in Punjab, along with the symbols allocated to them.
 






According to the PPP, the candidates included Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan Dullah from NA-58 Chakwal, Hasan Sardar from NA-59 Chakwal, Chaudhry Atif Rafique from NA-122 Lahore, Chaudhry Naushad from PP-20 Chakwal, Raja Amjad Noon from PP-21 Chakwal, Mujahid Islam from PP-119 Toba Tek Singh and Muhammad Fayyaz from PP-163 Lahore; some of whom have got relief on court orders.
PPP’s own mistake
An ECP official, when contacted, tried to downplay the controversy over allotment of symbols of independents to PPP candidates by claiming that they were either seeking the symbol of another party when they submitted nomination papers or left the column of party affiliation blank.
“It is inappropriate both for the PPP and its candidates to blame ECP or ROs for their own mistake,” the official said.
Talking to Dawn, Senator Taj Haider questioned why they had been allocated symbols meant for independent candidates, if they had asked for a symbol of another party.
He expressed surprise over the ECP’s directive and said a wrong has to be rectified. “Start of ballot papers’ printing cannot be an excuse,” he remarked.
He said the possibility of ROs drawn from the district administration doing it “under PML-N pressure” cannot be ruled out. He said lack of knowledge of ROs about the relevant law could also be a reason.
Removal of biased ROs
Meanwhile, in yet another letter written to the CEC on Tuesday, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Senator Taj Haider regretted that in spite of agreement of the ECP’s lawyer before the Lahore High Court on allotting the party symbol (arrow) to the PPP candidate from PP 163, ‘the extremely biased returning officer’ of the constituency has raised frivolous objections to the issue of party ticket to candidate Fayyaz Bhatti.
 






Under Section 66 of the Elections Act 2017, he said, the presentation of the party ticket by a candidate to the RO was sufficient proof of affiliation of the candidate with that political party. “It is unfortunate that the RO with mala fide intent continues to obstruct the allotment of the party ticket to our candidate.
“His action and attitude amounts to a clear contempt of the Lahore High Court. In this situation besides requesting that the symbol should be allotted to our candidate without further delay we demand that the biased returning officer should be removed from his position”, the letter reads.
PPP’s election cell member Barrister Amir Hassan alleged that the RO was working at the behest of the rival PML-N to weaken PPP’s vote bank in NA-127 constituency, where PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is in the race.
He alleged that the PML-N being afraid of Bilawal’s entry into the political arena of Lahore was attempting to manipulate the elections through ‘corrupt’ officialdom. He said the party would register its protest against the RO before the Election Commission offices if the party’s election symbol was not allotted to Mr Bhatti.

AML leader to be brought to court today; LHC reserves verdict on petition challenging acceptance of his nomination papers

The court confirmed the pre-arrest bail of Sheikh Rashid Shafique and Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, but cancelled the bail of the former interior minister in the New Town case.
On Tuesday, the AML leader appeared before the court of ATC-I Judge Malik Asif Ejaz for the hearing of his bail plea.

In a related development, the full bench of the Lahore High Court on Tuesday reserved verdict on a petition challenging the acceptance of Mr Rashid’s nomination papers from NA-56 and NA-57 of Rawalpindi. 
A citizen, Muhammad Arsalan, filed the petition pleading that the respondent was a defaulter of government taxes and he has concealed details of his assets in the nomination papers. 
He asked the full bench to set aside decisions of the ROs and the appellate tribunal regarding the acceptance of the respondent’s nomination papers for Feb 8 general elections.

GAZA: Israeli tanks on Tuesday stormed back into parts of the northern Gaza Strip they had left last week, reigniting some of the most intense fighting since the New Year when Israel announced it was scaling back its operations there.
Massive explosions shook northern areas of Gaza from across the border with Israel — a rarity over the past two weeks after Tel Aviv announced a drawdown of forces from the area as part of a transition to smaller, targeted operations.
The rattle of gunfire reverberated across the border through the night. In the morning, contrails snaked through the sky as Israel’s Iron Dome defences shot down rockets fired across the fence.
Israel claimed its forces had killed “dozens” of Hamas fighters overnight in clashes in Beit Lahiya, on Gaza’s northern edge.
 






Health authorities said the last 24 hours of Israeli bombing had killed 158 people in the Palestinian enclave, raising their toll for the war to 24,285, with thousands more bodies feared lost in the rubble.

158 Palestinians killed overnight; death toll hits 24,285

The Israeli bombardment has driven nearly all Gazans from their homes, some several times, and caused a humanitarian crisis, with food, fuel and medical supplies running low.
Change of plans
Some of the hundreds of thousands of residents who fled the north in October had begun returning last week to bombed-out areas where the Israelis had withdrawn. But residents said on Tuesday the resurgence of fighting in the north would now halt plans to try to go home.
“We almost planned to return to our house in Nazla, east of Jabalia, but thank God we didn’t. This morning people living nearby arrived here and told us the tanks pushed back there,” said Abu Khaled, 43, now living with relatives in severely damaged Gaza City.
“The sounds of bombing from the tanks, from the planes didn’t stop all night. It reminded us of the first day of the ground incursion.”
 






Israeli forces have fought their way to the centre of Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Yunis, and into towns north and east of the central city of Deir Al Balah.
Israeli commando forces carried out targeted raids in Khan Yunis to “take out Hamas’s infrastructure”, including offices of several senior regional commanders, the military said.
The Gaza crisis has inflamed tensions across the region, including in the Red Sea, where the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls most of Yemen has been attacking commercial ships. The route is used by 15pc of world shipping.

DES MOINES: Donald Trump has romped to a landslide victory in Iowa’s caucuses — the first vote in the US presidential race — cementing his status as the presumptive Republican standard-bearer to challenge President Joe Biden in November’s election. 
The former president has led polling for more than a year, but the contest offered the clearest insight yet into his ability to convert that advantage into a stunning White House return. 
Major US networks took just half an hour to call the race, with Trump taking 51 per cent of the vote on Monday and opening an unprecedented 30-point gap over Ron DeSantis — the biggest victory for an Iowa challenger in modern history. 
The Florida governor and Trump’s other main rival — former UN ambassador Nikki Haley — were locked at 21pc and 19pc, respectively, with DeSantis projected to take the runner-up spot. 

Victory demonstrates ex-president’s success in turning his prosecutions into a rallying cry

“Trump is the dominant candidate (in the Republican Party) and ‘contest one’ confirms the reality,” Julian E. Zelizer, professor of Public Affairs at Princeton University, said. 
There had been questions whether Trump would be hamstrung by his legal problems, as he faces multiple civil and criminal trials this year. 
But the extent of his victory demonstrated the 77-year-old’s success in turning his prosecutions into a rallying cry that has galvanised his followers as he takes his momentum into New Hampshire, the next state to nominate, next Tuesday. 
“I really think this is time now for everybody, the country, to come together,” Trump said in a rambling, uncharacteristically lackluster victory speech. 
Heart doctor Allan Latcham, 62, who voted before heading to Trump’s election party in Des Moines, hailed a “night for victory,” although he admitted he was surprised by the speed of the result call. 
DeSantis weakened 
Bundled up Iowa residents shuffled into more than 1,600 voting locations, braving sub-zero temperatures in a winter storm that dulled turnout and forced candidates to cancel events at the last minute. 
The margin of Trump victory was always the main question of the night, with analysts arguing that a gap of more than 30 points, or a voting share upwards of 50pc, would count as a good night. 
DeSantis confirmed that he would stay in the race to “reverse the madness that we’ve seen in this country” — although the governor is considered weak in New Hampshire and many analysts were declaring his campaign all but dead.
“Big winner tonight? Biden. He’s gonna get the candidate he wants: Trump,” Republican political consultant Mike Madrid posted on social media. 
Haley, the only woman in the Republican contest, was looking to outperform expectations in Iowa and ride into a one-on-one match-up with Trump in her preferred battleground of New Hampshire. 
Despite her third place finish, Haley dismissed DeSantis’s chances of building on his Iowa support level, and she vowed to avert the “nightmare” of a Trump-Biden rematch by winning in New Hampshire. 
Trump aides have been clear they want to see off the competition long before the Republican National Convention in July — and are keen for the party to coalesce around the front-runner before multiple expected court dates. 
But some Republican voters said they could not back another Trump presidency.

The Rawalpindi police authorities have ordered their field officers to start working on comprehensive security plans for all polling stations ahead of the Feb 8 elections.
Directives have been issued to identify venues for the establishment of effective security clusters at the polling station level and locate all sensitive places that require the deployment of the Pakistan Army, the Pakistan Rangers (Punjab), and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
Sources told The Express Tribune that the directives were issued through an official correspondence with the field police units.
Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Khalid Hamdani has recently sent a letter in this regard to SSP Operations Hafiz Kamran, SSP Investigation Zunaira Azfar, divisional SPs, SDPOs and SHOs of Rawal, Pothohar, Saddar and Kohsar divisions.
Per the letter, police have also been advised to provide the required strength of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras at the polling stations that fall in the ambit of the highly sensitive and sensitive category (category A). A total of 580 polling stations in Rawalpindi and Murree have been placed in category A, 978 in category B, and 1,219 in category C.

In a ground-breaking development, the Pakistan Post has commenced the direct delivery of computerised smart vehicle registration cards and number plates to the doorsteps of the citizens in the garrison city.
The initiative, which started Tuesday, marks a significant leap in convenience and efficiency. 
It aims to streamline and enhance the distribution process for transport owners and citizens.
The Rawalpindi General Post Office (GPO) received the initial batch of cards, which were part of an agreement between the Punjab Excise Taxation and Narcotics Control Department (ETNCD) and Pakistan Post. 
This collaboration focuses on providing a seamless, door-to-door service for the issuance of computerised smart vehicle registration cards and number plates.
Read  Virtual registration launched for swift vehicle processing
The ETNCD, after a pause of approximately seven months, has resumed the preparation of smart registration cards, underscoring the commitment to the agreed-upon collaboration. From July to August 2023, an impressive 7,000 computerised smart cards for vehicles and motorcycles were issued. 
However, delays and challenges in production and delivery have been persistent for the last two years.
The current backlog includes 30,000 smart cards and 45,000 computerised number plates registered in the Rawalpindi district.
Talking to The Express Tribune, the department sources confirmed that the production of smart cards resumed, with plans to complete the pending batch and dispatch them to owners by March. 
Simultaneously, preparations for the production of computerised number plates were set to commence within the next two weeks.
This innovative approach by Pakistan Post not only addresses the challenges faced in the previous years but also signifies a customer-centric commitment to providing efficient, doorstep services, making the process of obtaining smart registration cards and number plates a more convenient experience for the citizens of Rawalpindi.

The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) in collaboration with the Punjab Local Government and Community Development (LG&CD) department has kicked off the process of international bidding to award the contract for the ‘Developing Resilient Environment and Advancing Municipal Services’ (Dreams) project to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with Rs35 billion cost.
The projects of Chahan Dam, laying of a new pipeline inside the old water pipeline from Rawal Dam Lake to Syedpur, Rawalpindi and round-the-clock water supply to Khayaban-e-Sir Syed will be completed under the Dreams initiative.
The Chahan Dam project will provide 12 million gallons of water per day, while a new water pipeline to bring water from the Rawal Dam Lake will overcome the current leakages of the huge amount of water from the old pipeline. A 24-hour water supply project has also been planned for the Khayaban-e-Sir Syed area, for which the water coming from Khanpur Dam will be used.
The caretaker federal government and the Punjab government have completed negotiations with the ADB for funding the project. Both sides will sign an accord for the availability of funds soon.

The LG&CD department has set up a Project Management Unit (PMU), while the project will be executed by Wasa. The contract of the project will be awarded after the completion of international bidding. The project will help resolve the burning issue of non-supply of water to Rawalpindi.
Meanwhile, water experts have raised the alarm over depleting levels of groundwater. They said tube wells that were currently pumping water with struggle as the water levels deplete further. It would also become expensive due to rising electricity tariffs. Moreover, the continuously decreasing water table has made supplying water from underground sources an expensive exercise for the government.

Background
Rawalpindi’s daily water requirements stand at 68 million gallons, while the current supply from tube wells at Rawal Dam and Khanpur Dam only amounts to 51 million gallons.
Consequently, the city faces a daily water deficit of 17 million gallons.
To address this shortfall, WASA will secure an additional five million gallons of water daily by installing a 10-kilometre steel pipeline from Rawal Dam to Rawalpindi, replacing the old and deteriorated cemented pipeline. Simultaneously, the Chahan Dam project was expected to provide 12 million gallons of water per day.
Together, these measures will cover the daily water deficit of 17 million gallons.

Experts at a webinar highlighted the imperative to enhance information flow to stakeholders, including the media, and manage data governance to revolutionise agri-food systems.
The webinar titled "Potential of Agrifood Systems and Mitigating Climate Impacts" was organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in the federal capital. The event was participated virtually by many participants including members of academia, media and the development sector.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)’s representative in Pakistan, Florence Rolle, speaking on the occasion, said climate change is real and couldn’t be denied anymore. She added that Pakistan would have to adapt to climate change and extend effective incentives to its farmers in water conservation and crop productivity through alternative crops ensuring crop diversification.

She said due to rising temperature variability the country could focus on early crop sowing that could help generate more produce with the available water and resources provided the growing shift in pattern.
Rolle said there was a need to revisit the agriculture sector of Pakistan by farming systems and observe its weather patterns which will be the best combination of crop farmers and systems. "One billion people in the world couldn’t afford a healthy diet in the past years. The current agriculture food policy isn’t providing the desired relief and it's a window opportunity to revisit the policy," she maintained.
Rolle said there is an opportunity for Pakistan to improve the system and repurpose it to create more opportunities. "There is also a need to look into public access to diversified food which is safe along with ensuring food security, and food control systems that could bring elements for dialogue and look into the potential of diet, export of the commodities," she added.
She noted that data is important and Pakistan has developed varieties of species related to crop products.

The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has intervened to resolve a dispute over the actual increase in gas prices, as the national statistics agency has reported a staggering 1,100% increase, which is 10 times more than the interim government’s claim.
The dispute landed in the SIFC after the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) and the Ministry of Energy gave varying figures two months ago.
Officials said that the SIFC in its last meeting asked both the PBS and the Ministry of Energy to end the row within two weeks, a deadline that is ending this Thursday.
The SIFC was informed that the Ministry of Energy claimed that the increase in gas prices was 100%. But the PBS put the increase at 1,100%.
The SIFC asked the chief statistician to reconcile the data and the actual price situation should be reported to the next executive committee meeting of the SIFC, said the officials.
PBS reported on Friday that gas prices for the lowest income group were higher by 1,109% during the week ended on January 11, 2024 compared to the same week a year ago.
Inflation has remained sticky and poor people are bearing the brunt. PBS said that inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator skyrocketed to 44.2%.
However, it is unlikely that the PBS would be able to revise prices soon due to various administrative and technical procedures involved in the exercise.
The difference between prices quoted by the PBS and the Ministry of Energy was because of two major reasons. The interim government has slapped fixed monthly charges in the range of Rs465 to Rs2,000 per consumer and is of the view that the fixed charges should not be part of the price increase calculation.
Secondly, the Ministry of Energy is claiming that the majority of consumers were exempt from the price hike.
PBS officials said that after receiving SIFC instructions, the bureau had started reconciling the data. They said that the Ministry of Energy had shared the data of subsidised consumers of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC). But it has not yet shared consumer data of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited.
Read Traders voice concerns over inflated gas bills
PBS officials further said that fixed charges were also part of the price increase, as they had a direct bearing on consumers.
PBS reports inflation numbers based on financial year 2015-16. Any revision would have far-reaching implications for other macroeconomic indicators.
It will need the endorsement of a technical committee and the governing council for changing the calculation methodology.
Federal and provincial governments have not been able to contain inflation and the National Price Monitoring Committee has just become a debating body.
The monitoring committee met on Tuesday to review prices and came to the conclusion that an increase of 44.2% in overall prices was “driven by perishable items including tomatoes, onions and poultry products like chicken and eggs,” said a statement issued by the planning ministry.
The planning minister “asked about the measures taken by the provincial governments and Islamabad Capital Territory to curtail the gap between wholesale and retail prices”, it added.
Representatives of the food and industries departments of Punjab, Sindh and K-P claimed that strict monitoring of prices had been ensured through heavy fines, raids and sealing of shops demanding high rates.
However, yet prices of almost every essential good are on the rise.
In its last meeting, the SIFC also took up the challenges being faced in the collection of gas bills in Balochistan and Sindh. The provincial high court had allowed the government to recover provisional gas bills to the tune of Rs5,700 per month, which created resentment among consumers.
Similarly, the Sindh High Court has given a stay order against the recent gas price hike. The SIFC has directed SSGC to file review petitions in both the provincial courts.
Despite the increase in gas prices, the gas sector circular debt has mounted to Rs3.022 trillion as of November end, adversely affecting the financial health of petroleum companies.

The government has missed the deadlines set by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to secure support from official and private creditors for the division of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) into two entities, a prerequisite for privatisation.
Formal decisions have not been made on whether the privatisation ministry aims to sell the airline to a foreign government through negotiations or complete the process transparently through a competitive process, according to Ministry of Privatisation officials. However, during internal meetings, the privatisation minister has hinted at a potential negotiated deal.
A Scheme of Arrangement for segregating PIA into core and non-core entities couldn’t be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) due to the absence of statutory audited accounts of PIA until September 2023 and no objection certificates from creditors, as per government officials.
Secretary Privatisation Jawwad Paul and Secretary Privatisation Commission Usman Bajwa did not respond to questions regarding the missed SIFC deadlines.
Missing these deadlines could jeopardise the caretaker government’s goal to privatise the country’s third-highest loss-making entity before February 8th—the day when the interim cabinet becomes a lame duck.
The Privatisation Commission board has approved the transaction structure to sell a minimum of 51% stake after cleansing its balance sheet by transferring almost three-fourths of the Rs825 billion to a new company. The board also approved setting up a new holding company in which a majority of the airline’s debt could be parked in order to sell it with a clean balance sheet. However, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the federal cabinet have not yet endorsed the board’s decision.
Spokesperson for the finance ministry, Qamar Abbasi, stated that the Ministry of Finance has been fully supportive of the privatisation process of PIA and has been working closely with the Privatisation Commission. He mentioned that the process to finalise the scheme of arrangements was underway, which would pave the way for finalising modalities for managing debt and resolving any other issues.
The SIFC had set January 11th as the deadline to secure no-objection certificates for moving the debt and trade payables of commercial banks, the Civil Aviation Authority, Pakistan State Oil, Federal Board of Revenue, and National Insurance Corporation Limited into a new company, as per officials.
The civil-military body instructed the privatisation ministry to take all pending actions before the end of this month, with strict adherence to timelines.
The SIFC had asked the ministry to decide by January 15th to 20th whether the airline would be sold through a negotiated deal or a competitive bidding process. It also instructed that the scheme of arrangement should be filed with the SECP by January 20th and get its approval. However, these prerequisites have not been met.
Read PC okays 51% PIA stake sale
The privatisation ministry requires statutory audits of PIA accounts until September 30th, 2023, following the International Financial Reporting Standards. Sources said, the audit is incomplete, and the SECP has refused to grant a waiver.
The privatisation ministry was hopeful of obtaining a waiver from the SECP, but the corporate sector preferred to adhere strictly to the established procedures.
The second requirement for filing the scheme of arrangement is securing no objection certificates from commercial banks for their Rs281 billion lending and government entities for their combined lending of Rs162 billion to PIA.
The SIFC had instructed the CAA, PSO, FBR, and NICL to give their NOCs by January 11th. PIA owes Rs120 billion to CAA, and the status of the NOC from CAA remains unclear.
The FBR needs to recover Rs19 billion from PIA, and the NOC from the tax machinery is pending. The status of the Rs19 billion, whether it will be written off or parked in the new holding company, is also unclear.
Similarly, PSO needs to recover Rs20 billion from PIA, and without an NOC, its debt cannot be transferred to a new entity.
The SIFC set a January 31st deadline to find a solution to the legacy loans of PIA and their settlement, but tangible progress hasn’t been made.
Aviation Secretary Saif Anjum was not available for comments.
According to the financial advisor’s report, PIA’s debt and liabilities have surged to a record Rs825 billion. Financial advisors have proposed parking around Rs640 billion in a new holding company.
The Rs825 billion includes Rs457 billion debt, Rs163 billion loan by the Ministry of Finance to PIA, and Rs83 billion debt of foreign creditors. The commercial banks’ debt amounts to Rs281 billion, and PIA also owes Rs65 billion to its employees.
Numerous meetings have been held between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Privatisation to resolve the issue, but the finance minister is reluctant to take PIA’s debt onto the government’s books.
Qamar Abbasi stated that PIA’s debt management was linked with the finalisation of the scheme of arrangement.
The SIFC also set a January 11th deadline to find a solution to the commercial banks’ Rs281 billion debt.

In the agricultural landscape of Pakistan, the fertiliser sector is experiencing a notable shift as Diammonium Phosphates (DAP) takes the lead with a significant surge of 31% in offtake during the Calendar Year 2023. In contrast, urea, a staple fertiliser for farmers, has seen marginal growth, remaining virtually stagnant over the same period.
According to Optimus Capital Management, urea offtakes for CY23 reached 6,642 Kilo Tonnes (KT), a modest increase from 6,612 KT in CY22. Meanwhile, DAP offtakes for CY23 demonstrated a substantial rise, standing at 1,576 KT compared to 1,201 KT in CY22.
Analysing the total availability, including local production and imports, urea recorded 6,738 KT in CY23, showing a slight drop of 2% from 6,884 KT in CY22. On the other hand, DAP’s total availability witnessed an 11% increase, reaching 1,608 KT in CY23 compared to 1,445 KT in CY22.
The offtakes for Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) experienced an 8% decrease in CY23, standing at 800 KT against 868 KT in CY22. NitroPhos (NP) offtakes, on the contrary, surged by 46% in CY23, reaching 1,085 KT compared to 741 KT in CY22.
Monthly data indicated that in December 2023 a 2.78% uptick in urea offtake, reaching 628 MT, compared to 611 MT in November 2023. However, this marked a 24% decline from the figures in December 2022, which stood at 833 KT.

Conversely, DAP offtake in December 2023 decreased significantly to 138 KT from 278 KT in November, marking a sharp 50% decline. Compared to December 2022 figures of 154 KT, this represented a decrease of 10.39%.
Optimus Capital Management noted that the additional import of 152 KT of urea is expected to maintain fertiliser availability, but as the import price burden is shifted to farmers, no contraction in urea prices is foreseen. Despite the average international urea prices decreasing from $371/tonne to $323/tonne, local prices rose from $278/tonne to $316/tonne, leading to a contraction in local price discounts.
In the Rabi season, DAP prices continued their ascent, reaching $969/tonne in December 2023 against $917/tonne in November 2023. This surge expanded the price premium to 56%, despite international DAP prices remaining relatively stable, according to the brokerage house.

The Pakistani currency closed stable at Rs280.25 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Tuesday, breaking a two-week winning streak as demand and supply positions of the foreign currency balanced out.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency edged down Rs0.01 to close at Rs280.25 against the greenback.
Over the past nine consecutive working days, the currency maintained a gradual uptrend, cumulatively gaining 0.59% or Rs1.65. So far, it has strengthened by 9.58% or Rs26.86 in the past four months compared to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported a 0.24% or Rs0.67 day-to-day increase, closing at Rs282.92/$ in the open market.
The stability in the interbank market is attributed to diverse developments, including fluctuations in international oil and gas prices due to the ongoing Middle Eastern crisis.
Global energy supplies faced disruption due to tension rising in the Red Sea, causing uncertainty in future energy prices. Any increase in energy prices could lead to a higher demand for the US dollar in local markets, given Pakistan’s heavy reliance on imported fuels.
Read Rupee strengthens, hits 11-week high
However, energy prices have maintained a downward trend so far, with sufficient fuel inventories reported by the US and Europe. This suggests that commodity prices may continue to decline, reducing demand for the US dollar from local traders.
Stable foreign currency inflows through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDAs) from overseas Pakistanis and the potential receipt of the next International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan tranche of $700 million, following the approval of its immediate release by the executive board, further supported the Pakistani rupee.

Hub Power Company (Hubco) has kicked off talks to acquire a stake in the country’s top coal-rich mine that is supplying black gold to run power plants, believing that the acquisition will prove financially beneficial.
Besides, Kot Addu Power Company (Kapco) is attempting to acquire a wind power project of 49.5 megawatts located in Sindh, diversifying its operations by embracing clean energy. Hubco said in a notification to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday “the board of directors of Hub Power has authorised the company to enter into negotiations and execute definitive agreements for the proposed acquisition of shares of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company Limited (SECMC) held by a potential seller.”
The company, however, did not mention how much stake it was planning to take in the mining company. The completion of the proposed transaction is subject to necessary corporate and regulatory approvals and consent, and execution of definitive documents, the notification added.
SECMC is operating Pakistan’s first open-pit lignite mine in block-II of Tharparkar in Sindh. Including other blocks, Thar has one of the world’s largest coal reserves of 175 billion tons, which are equivalent to 50 billion tons of oil and 2,000 trillion cubic feet of gas.
“With the current annual mining capacity of 7.6 million tons, we continue to provide lignite quality coal to power producers in Pakistan,” SECMC said on its website. Arif Habib Limited analyst Muhammad Amad said in a commentary the sellers of SECMC’s stake may include Engro with 12% shareholding, Thal Limited another 12% stake, HBL 9% and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) 4%.
“If Hubco acquires the stake from Engro, it is anticipated to positively impact its earnings by Rs0.73 per share (total impact of Rs947 million). A similar outcome is expected if the stake is acquired from Thal Limited,” he said.
“Alternatively, acquiring HBL’s stake would have a positive impact of Rs0.55 per share (or Rs710 million) on the profitability of Hubco. Additionally, Hubco can enhance its stake in SECMC by 4% through the purchase of all CMEC shares, resulting in a positive impact of Rs0.24 per share (Rs316 million).”

Continuing its descend, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) moved further south on Tuesday as investors weighed the slim large-scale manufacturing (LSM) growth of 1.59% year-on-year (YoY) , weakening rupee and political uncertainty.
In the morning, the day began with robust trading when the index touched its intra-day high at 64,246.67 points. However, owing to profit-taking and reports saying that the delisting committee had set Pak Suzuki Motor Company’s (PSMC) share price way below expectations at Rs609, the market fell rapidly. As a result, the index dipped below the 64,000 mark, hitting the intra-day low at 63,397.94 before midday. The downturn was also influenced by geopolitical uncertainty and apprehensions surrounding the energy sector’s circular debt that surpassed Rs5.73 trillion.
“Stocks closed bearish as investors weighed the modest LSM growth of 1.59% YoY in November 2023, weak rupee and political noise,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Speculation in the auto sector amid lower-than-expected minimum share buyback price for PSMC, geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over power and gas sector’s circular debt reaching Rs5.73 trillion played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.” At close, the KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 531.91 points, or 0.83%, and settled at 63,737.46.
Topline Securities, in its report, commented that profit-taking dominated Tuesday’s trading activities. “Negativity loomed when the delisting committee set PSMC’s price at Rs609/share, dashing market expectations of a significantly higher valuation,” it said.

Profit-booking marked trading in the E&P sector, leading PPL (-4.14%) and OGDC (-2.97%) to close in the red, Topline added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 407.5 million shares against Monday’s tally of 382.01 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.6 billion.
Shares of 338 companies were traded. Of these, 92 stocks closed higher, 219 dropped and 27 remained unchanged.

BYD Explorer No 1, a vehicle carrier vessel leased to Chinese automaker BYD, held its maiden voyage ceremony on Monday at a port in Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong province.
With more than 5,000 new energy vehicles (NEVs) on board, it will set sail for the ports of Vlissingen in the Netherlands and Bremerhaven in Germany.
It is the first vessel in the shipping fleet of BYD, which has joined a number of Chinese automakers in accelerating car exports by operating their own shipping fleets.
According to China International Marine Containers (Group) Co Ltd (CIMC), the vessel was built by CIMC Raffles, a subsidiary of CIMC, for international ship management company Zodiac Maritime and was leased to BYD.
The vessel was delivered on Tuesday to a construction base in Longkou, east China’s Shandong province, before sailing to Yantai Port to be loaded with the first batch of 1,389 NEVs. On Sunday, the vessel arrived at Shenzhen and was loaded with the second batch of some 4,000 NEVs.
According to China’s General Administration of Customs, China’s auto exports surged to 5.22 million vehicles in 2023, up 57.4% year on year. As the country’s automobile industry embraces a new export era, automakers are grappling with challenges such as soaring rents, shipping capacity constraints, and intense competition for available car carriers.
Data from global shipping research institution Clarksons Research shows that from August 2020 to the end of November 2023, the one-year time charter rate for a 6,500 car equivalent unit (CEU) pure car and truck carrier (PCTC) had soared from $10,000 per day to $115,000 per day, an increase of more than 10 times.
Read Chinese automakers embrace export boom with own shipping fleets
To bolster automobile exports, major Chinese automakers, including BYD, Chery, and SAIC, have ventured into establishing their own fleets. Notably, Guangzhou Shipyard International Company Limited successfully implemented an order for two BYD PCTCs on January 23, 2023, while Chery Group subsequently announced plans to establish its own global shipping fleet.
SAIC’s Anji Logistics, in the past two years, has also ordered a number of large car carriers exceeding 7,000 vehicles each from the Jiangnan Shipyard.
In recent years, the concentration of the global automobile shipping market has remained high, with automakers in Japan, Korea and other countries having deep ties with the transportation link. According to data from the research institute of China Merchants Bank, as of November 2021, the global capacity of the top 10 car transport shipping companies – mainly from Japan, Korea and European countries – accounted for 59.42% of the market share, while the car transport capacity of Japan and Korea is mostly occupied by their domestic car manufacturers.
Previously, China’s status as a major auto exporter was limited, resulting in minimal emphasis on building an independent shipping fleet. Currently, China has 39 car carrier vessels with a total of 115,000 CEU, representing 2.8% of the global shipping capacity.

The government has outlined a series of initiatives to breathe new life into Pakistan’s agriculture sector. These include the formulation of a national seed policy and the introduction of the Agriculture Development Authority Act to facilitate corporate farming in Pakistan.
Sources informed The Express Tribune that the Ministry of Food has developed several initiatives and is in the process of consulting with all stakeholders, including provincial authorities. These initiatives aim to restructure the agriculture sector, addressing key challenges and fostering sustainable growth.
As part of this plan, the government is considering delisting underperforming seed companies that have failed to contribute positively to the introduction of quality seeds in Pakistan. Fraudulent practices by seed and pesticide companies have led to the collapse of the agriculture sector, with farmers falling victim to poor-quality seeds.
Sources in the food ministry said the ministry presented an action plan in a high-level meeting before the prime minister, outlining various components, including the finalisation of the Federal Seed Policy. The policy draft has been prepared, and consultations with provinces are on the agenda. 
Agricultural Development Act for Corporate Farming
The government envisions opening up the agriculture sector to corporate companies, attracting investment and modern technology to boost crop yields. The Ministry of Food and National Security has prepared a draft for the Agricultural Development Authority Act, which is currently under consultation with provinces.
Under this act, companies can secure large land areas on long-term leases, expecting to bring in capital, machinery, equipment, skilled personnel, and global market connections. Unlike Pakistan’s current small-scale, family-owned, or tenant-operated farms, these corporate farms will be professionally managed, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.
Initial responses to the concept of corporate farming are positive, especially from Gulf countries seeking stable food sources. However, concerns have been raised about potential adverse effects on small farmers, herders, and local consumers, particularly regarding land and water allocation and potential food price hikes.
Framework for Land Usage
The federal government has urged the chief minister of Punjab to share the plan and legal requirements with other provinces to make identified land usable for investors and corporate farming. Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber-Pakhtukhwa (K-P) have been asked to provide timelines for the implementation of legal requirements similar to those followed by Punjab.
Read Despite progress, challenges persist in agriculture sector
The Ministry of Food has also been tasked with sharing comprehensive details, including eligibility criteria, the application process, and terms and conditions for obtaining land for corporate farming.
National Seed Policy
The government plans to rename the Federal Seed Policy as the National Seed Policy. The Ministry of Food Security aims to seek approval from relevant authorities in Pakistan to execute this plan. Additionally, there are plans to provide digital literacy training to Pakistani farmers, enabling them to adopt modern farming techniques. IT companies have initiated various projects globally, leveraging artificial intelligence to revolutionise farming practices. The government aims to integrate these advancements into the agriculture sector.
Restructuring Seed Authority
To modernise the seed industry, the government plans to restructure the Seed Authority. A comprehensive plan is in place to introduce modern techniques and ensure the production and distribution of high-quality seeds. Additionally, underperforming seed companies that have hindered progress in the agriculture sector may face delisting.
Livestock and Horticulture Focus
The food ministry will conduct a market and investment pre-feasibility study in the livestock and horticulture sectors to evaluate investment potential and stimulate growth. The government aims to identify standard and uniform farm-level practices, preparing guidelines for streamlined farming processes at large, medium, and small farm levels. This approach seeks to guide farmers, particularly those with small holdings, toward enhanced productivity.
Overhaul of Departments
In an effort to enhance effectiveness, the government plans to overhaul the Department of Plant Protection and the Animal Quarantine Department. A study is being conducted to evaluate their performance and propose restructuring measures for the future. This initiative is crucial for responding to evolving threats to crops and livestock, implementing efficient quarantine measures, and ensuring overall biosecurity.

An Iranian drone and missile strike on targets, which Tehran described as bases for the militant group Jaish al-Adl, in the Panjgur district of Balochistan killed two “innocent children” and wounded three girls, Iranian state media and Foreign Office in Islamabad said on Tuesday.
Pakistan condemned the attack, describing it an “unprovoked violation” of the Pakistani airspace, and warned Tehran of serious consequences. The Foreign Office said in a late-night statement that the violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty was completely unacceptable.
Two bases of Jaish al Adl in Pakistan were targeted by missiles on Tuesday, Iranian state media reported, a day after Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards missiles strikes hit an “Israeli spy centre” in Iraq and targeted Islamic State militants in Syria.
"These bases were hit and destroyed by missiles and drones," media reports in Tehran said. Iran's Nournews, affiliated with the country's top security body, said the attacked bases were located in the Balochistan province.
However, Pakistan contested Iran’s claims that the strikes destroyed “terrorist hideouts” and strongly protested with the neighbouring country. “This violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty is completely unacceptable and can have serious consequences,” the Foreign Office statement said.
Jaish-al-Adl is a militant group established in 2012 and had been operating from Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan province. Tehran alleges that the group also has hideouts across the border in Pakistan.
The group since its inception took responsibility of several attacks against Iran’s security forces.
In February 2019, the group killed 27 security personnel, prompting Iranian civil and military leadership to issue stern warnings to Pakistan.

However, Tuesday’s strike came as major surprise because Tehran opted for this option despite existence of channels of communication between the two countries.
Also, the strikes were launched the day Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar met with the Iranian foreign minister on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. The Iranian president’s point man for Afghanistan was also in Islamabad, recently.
Soon after the attack, Pakistan’s strong protest was lodged with the concerned senior official in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran, while Iran’s charge d’affaires was summoned by the foreign ministry.
“Additionally, the Iranian charge d’affaires has been called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey our strongest condemnation of this blatant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and that the responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran.” according to the Foreign Office statement.
“It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the Foreign Office said. “Such unilateral acts are not in conformity with good neighbourly relations and can seriously undermine bilateral trust and confidence.”
The statement reiterated that Pakistan had always said that terrorism was a common threat to all countries in the region that required coordinated action.
Former prime minister and PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif has said that had the PTI used the bat to play an innings for the progress and prosperity of the country, today’s state of national affairs and the condition of the people of Pakistan would have been totally different.
In a recent interview with a private news channel, he highlighted the missed opportunities by the PTI government, emphasising that a different trajectory could have been set for the country's progress and prosperity.
He pointed out that the Election Commission had issued notices to the PTI in 2021 when it was in power, not the PML-N. Therefore, the consequences of the notice are solely legal, and the PTI has no one else to blame for this matter.
Discussing the serious cases leading to Imran Khan's incarceration, Shehbaz stated, "Imran is behind bars as a result of serious cases like the May 9 treason and £190 million, which was deposited elsewhere instead of the national treasury. This is purely a matter of law rather than anything else."
Highlighting the economic challenges, Shehbaz criticised the PTI government's decisions, citing a ruined economy marked by inflation reaching unprecedented levels.
He pointed out the damaged diplomatic ties and torn treaties with the IMF as further consequences of the PTI reign.
Shehbaz expressed optimism about the PML-N's performance in the upcoming elections, saying: "Recent polls show the PML-N making significant gains, indicating that the party is peaking at the right time. All surveys suggest that Nawaz Sharif will lead the country."
Speaking on the challenges faced by the common man, he said: "The elite can seek the best treatment abroad, but today, the common man is petrified even thinking about the cost of medical treatment, medicines, education and employment."
He recalled the times in 2013 when Nawaz provided free treatment, medicines, and education for the poor.
Addressing the ousting of Nawaz’s government, Shehbaz acknowledged that the then chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar's role but emphasised Nawaz’s response, stating: "Nawaz Sharif is not just a politician; he is a statesman."
Discussing the potential of Pakistan's youth, Shehbaz urged the younger generation to prioritise education, emphasising that the future lies in IT, and the youth are the country's biggest asset.
Concluding the interview, he reiterated the PML-N's commitment to public service, stating: "Punjab is the largest province and the stronghold of the PML-N; the people of Punjab and Pakistan trust the PML-N to deliver because of our public service."

Maryam vows to end inflation
PML-N Senior Vice President and Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz has vowed to end inflation and resume development work if her party is voted to power during the general elections on Feb 8.
While addressing the party workers at the beginning of the election campaign in the PP-159 constituency, Maryam said that the infiltrators occupied Lahore for the last five years and did not carry out a single development work, but the mark of service left by her party was there.
“On Feb 8, the infiltrators have to be thrown out of Lahore. The more seals are placed on the tiger, the faster the development work will be and inflation will end,” Maryam said.
Parvez Rasheed, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Rana Mubasher Iqbal and others were also present.
Maryam was warmly welcomed on her arrival in the constituency.
Maryam said that she would serve the people day and night if they made tiger victorious in the general elections.
“You can see that the metro bus is passing somewhere and the speedo bus is passing somewhere. You will see the signs of service of Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and the tiger.”
She said, “You made Rana Mubasher successful by voting for him repeatedly. He is the silent mujahid of Nawaz Sharif. He is standing in the constituency today because he has served you day and night for five years.”
The PML-N SVP said in five years, the wheel of development did not move forward, accusing the then chief justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar of stopping the Orange Line project for one-and-a-half years.
She said after the departure of PML-N, there was no development work here and Lahore became abandoned.
“There is no one to pick up the garbage here. These infiltrators have to be thrown out of Lahore on Feb 8, as they have only filled their pockets and did no work.”
The chief organiser said after Feb 8, the journey of development would resume from where it had stopped and the destiny of Punjab and Pakistan, including this constituency, would be changed.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday threatened to postpone the next general elections in certain constituencies if the process of changing electoral symbols did not stop, saying that it could not keep making alterations, especially when the polls were just around the corner.
In a blunt statement, the ECP did not mince words to say that the elections would be postponed in the constituencies where the political parties or candidates had requested to change their electoral symbols as the commission had already ordered the printing of the ballot papers for the general polls scheduled to be held on Feb 8.
Although some political leaders, including PPP Co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari as well as JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, have casually called for delaying the elections and the Senate passed a resolution seeking the postponement of elections – because of security concerns and the harsh winter season, this is the first time the commission has bluntly said the process of changing of electoral symbols must be stopped now or the polls would be put off.
Apparently, the ECP’s statement has come in response to the requests made by political parties and candidates to change their electoral symbols as well as the applications pending before the higher courts.
Senator Taj Haider, the in-charge of the PPP’s central polls cell, recently wrote to the chief election commissioner (CEC), asking that the ECP should change the electoral symbols of at least seven of its candidates as they had not been allotted the ‘arrow’, pointing out that the returning officers declared them as independent ones.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Secretary General Nayyar Hussain Bukhari also raised the issue, saying the matter would be taken to courts.
In a statement, Bukhari said the PPP candidates, including Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan Dullah from NA-58 Chakwal, Hasan Sardar from NA-59 Chakwal, Chaudhry Atif Rafique from NA-122 Lahore, Chaudhry Naushad from PP-20 Chakwal, Raja Amjad Noon from PP-21 Chakwal, Mujahid Islam from PP-119 Toba Tek Singh and Muhammad Fayyaz from PP-163 Lahore, had entered the race on the party’s tickets but they had been allotted different symbols.
In response, the ECP officials refuted the PPP’s allegation that its candidates had been denied the party symbol and described the statement as prone to exaggeration.
The ECP officials maintained that the PPP was drumbeating over the issue as the candidates either sought the electoral symbol of another political party when they submitted nomination papers or left the column of their affiliation “blank”.

Similarly, PTI founding chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan’s plea against the rejection of his nomination papers is still pending with the Lahore High Court.
On Tuesday, the LHC reserved its verdict on Imran’s appeal challenging the decisions of the returning officers as well as the tribunals that have rejected his nomination papers from NA-122 Lahore and NA-89 Mianwali.
While leaving nothing to imagination about the possible delay in polls in different constituencies, the ECP noted that the electoral symbols were being changed from various forums after they were allotted to political parties and independent candidates.
In the statement, the ECP said it should be noted that after the allotment of the electoral symbols, the commission had ordered the printing of ballot papers to three printing corporations and they had already started their work.
“If the process of changing election symbols continues in this way then, on the one hand, there is a fear of delay in the election because the ballot paper will have to be reprinted, for which time is already limited,” the ECP statement read.
It continued that the special ballot papers would have to be reprinted. The statement added that those already printed would be lost.
Pointing out that 800 tons of paper was used for printing the ballot papers in the 2018 elections, the ECP said it was estimated that 2,070 tons would be used for this purpose in the 2024 polls.
Similarly, it explained that 11,700 candidates had participated in the 2018 elections, while this time, 18,059 were in the fray.
“In 2018, 220 million ballot papers were printed while this time 260 million ballot papers are being printed,” it elaborated.
The statement read that in this connection, the ECP was holding meetings on how to deal with the situation.
“The proposal is also being considered that if this process of changing election symbols does not stop, there will be no other option but to postpone the elections in such constituencies,” the statement concluded.
Separately, in a major reshuffle in the ECP, the resignation of its secretary Omar Hamid Khan has been accepted – with Dr Syed Asif Hussain replacing him – in addition to the transfers and postings of its other high-ups, including provincial commissioners.
The ECP issued separate notifications – one for accepting Hamid’s resignation and the other for Asif’s appointment.
According to the first notification, Hamid tendered his resignation because of ill health and it was approved by the CEC as per the rules of the ECP, effective immediately.
Hamid was appointed the ECP secretary on July 9, 2021 and held the post till his resignation on Jan 16, 2024.
The other notification read that the CEC had appointed Asif as the new secretary under Section 6(2) of the Elections Act, 2017 along with eight, nine and 10 of the Election Commission Rules 1989.
Asif is a retired officer of Grade-22 and was serving as the special secretary at the ECP Secretariat in Islamabad before his new assignment.
The notification added that the appointment would be effective immediately on a one-year contractual basis in public interest.
It should be noted that last week there were news stories of the ECP secretary’s resignation but the commission’s spokesperson claimed that Hamid was on leave after contracting Covid-19 and he would resume his duties as soon as his health permitted.
In another notification, the ECP informed that Balochistan Election Commissioner Aijaz Anwer Chohan has been appointed as the new Punjab election commissioner in place of Saeed Gul, who has been transferred to the post of director general (Elections' Cell & Head of Elections' Wing) at the commission’s secretariat in Islamabad.
Similarly, Punjab Election Commissioner Farid Afridi has been appointed the new Balochistan election commissioner.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) successfully apprehended 18 individuals attempting to illegally migrate to Gulf countries by sea in a raid conducted in the Gwadar district of Balochistan. The crackdown, led by Deputy Director Asif Naseem, aimed to combat the menace of illegal migration.
Acting on confidential information, ASI Abdul Ghaffar, alongside the FIA Team Gwadar and FIA Composite Circle Gwadar, carried out targeted operations at various locations in Gwadar. These efforts were aimed at curbing the activities of human traffickers who exploit the Arabian Sea in Mekran for smuggling individuals to Gulf States.
The recent operations resulted in the apprehension of 13 individuals hailing from different districts of Punjab, four Afghan nationals, and one facilitator orchestrating illegal migration. The arrests adhered to established protocols, and the detained individuals are currently undergoing thorough investigations.

Asif Naseem emphasized the agency’s dedication to addressing the serious issue of human trafficking. He commended the proactive role of ASI Abdul Ghaffar and the entire FIA team in Gwadar for their commitment to upholding the law and ensuring the safety of individuals seeking a better life abroad.
The detained individuals, who attempted to travel to foreign countries illegally, are now subject to legal proceedings. The FIA remains steadfast in its efforts to uncover the networks behind such activities, focusing on dismantling human trafficking operations and protecting vulnerable individuals from falling prey to these criminal enterprises, according to a well-informed source within the agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to communicate with the media.
This latest crackdown sends a clear message to those involved in human trafficking, underscoring the FIA’s commitment to maintaining the security and integrity of the immigration process.

The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has mobilized an additional 26,213 security personnel from various provincial departments in preparation for the upcoming general elections in the province. 
This announcement came during a crucial meeting held on Tuesday, chaired by Caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retd) Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, to assess the government’s readiness for the impending elections.
This surge in security personnel aims to fortify the electoral process and maintain order across the province during the upcoming polls. The move underscores the government’s commitment to fostering a secure and conducive environment for citizens to exercise their democratic rights.
During the meeting, it was underscored that the forthcoming general elections would mark a historic occasion, as both national and provincial assemblies’ elections are set to be conducted simultaneously in both the settled and merged districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. 
This synchronized approach is a noteworthy departure from previous election practices, signaling an alignment with contemporary democratic norms.
A total of 45 general seats in the National Assembly and 115 general seats in the Provincial Assembly will be contested in the upcoming elections. The electoral landscape will comprise 15,737 polling stations strategically distributed across the province. 
Read Balochistan to install CCTV cameras at sensitive stations
Out of these, 4,812 have been categorized as the most sensitive, 6,581 as sensitive, and 4,344 as normal. Additionally, 1,919 polling stations are earmarked for the snow-bound areas of the province, taking into account the unique challenges posed by weather conditions.
The registered voter count for Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa stands at an impressive 21,692,381 individuals.
Security arrangements for the elections were outlined in detail during the meeting. The most sensitive polling stations, especially in the southern belt and merged districts, will be manned by 11 security personnel each. 
Similarly, seven security personnel will be deployed at most sensitive polling stations in the rest of the districts. For sensitive polling stations, seven security personnel will be assigned in the merged and southern districts, while five security personnel will cover similar stations in the rest of the districts. Normal polling stations will see the deployment of four security personnel in the merged and southern districts and four or five in the rest of the districts.
Despite the meticulous planning, the government faces a challenge in meeting the required number of security personnel. Presently, only 89,959 police personnel are available, creating a shortfall of 25,471. In an effort to bridge this gap, the Ministry of Interior has been approached to secure additional support, including four Wings of Frontier Corps and 165 Platoons of Frontier Constabulary.

Apart from their breathtaking landscape and picturesque sceneries, Pakistan’s northern areas are well known for producing some of the country’s finest variety of fruits and vegetables. In recent times however, the drastic changes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (K-P) weather conditions and rainfall rate have come as a bolt from the blue for its agriculturalists, who rely heavily on farming for sustaining their livelihoods.
Nawab Khan is one such farmer from the Utmanzai district of Charsadda, who has been harvesting sugarcane and strawberry crops since the past 13 years. This year however, a severe scarcity of water due to a lack of adequate rainfall significantly reduced his crop yield. “My strawberry crop yield had declined by almost 50 per cent in March last year while the sugarcane crop also faced a similar drop in yield from November onwards,” resented Khan, who further claimed that the number of people associated with farming in Charsadda had reduced to half given the changing weather conditions and declining profitability of the profession.
Similarly, Nisar Chacha, who has been cultivating carrots in the Utmanzai area for the past 10 years, also worried about the sudden changes in rainfall and weather conditions. “Over the past five years, water scarcity has caused the cost of producing carrots to increase by five to 10 times,” regretted Nisar, who disclosed that a similar quandary was plaguing the orange production zones in Manki Sharif, Pir Piai and Ziarat Kaka Sahib located in the Nowshera district of K-P.
Confirming Nisar’s speculation, Shafiq Khan, an orange farmer from Ziarat Kaka Sahib told the Express Tribune that the growing scantiness of rainfall had significantly impacted the quantity and quality of his produce. “Blood oranges require ample rainwater during the harvest period, in order to develop their natural juiciness and sweetness. Unfortunately, the lack of rainfall has not only reduced our yield by 30 per cent but has also ruined the distinctive zesty flavour of our oranges,” expressed Khan.

Apart from blood oranges, several districts like Kohat and Hingo are also fairly famous for producing a splendid variety of guavas. However, just like the other citrus fruits, these too have observed a downward trend in production.
“Premature rains and scarcity of rainfall have greatly shortened the guava production season in Kohat. Furthermore, the little guava that is produced tastes no way near what it used to taste like,” said Nimroz, a guava farmer, who also claimed that wheat production in Lower Chitral had also been hampered.
“In case there is no rainfall in the upcoming few days, there is a high risk of the wheat drying up, which will cause immense trouble to the local people,” warned Saud, a farmer from Drosh in Chitral.
According to Dr Farida Anjum, a researcher working as an agriculture officer for the Department of Agriculture K-P, extreme heat during summers, and changing weather conditions during winters had definitely posed a new challenge to the agriculture sector “Such challenges can be better tackled through measures taken at the local, regional and national levels,” she opined.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the impact of climate change on crop production and quality in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dr Attaur Rahman, an agronomist and climatologist said, “Usually, cold winds enter Pakistan from the Central Asian countries through Afghanistan during winters, triggering a spell of seasonal rainfall. This year, however, we only had the smog season and very little rainfall was recorded. All relevant departments are working together towards tackling climate change in the province, but due to a lack of coordination, the problem remains unresolved.”

The candidates of Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Awami National Party (ANP) are competing against each other in the general elections 2024 in various national and provincial constituencies of Karachi.
The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) a conglomerate of parties formed to oust Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government could not sustain and they have pitted candidates against each other, which, according to political pundits would eventually benefit a single party.
Until a few weeks ago, the top leadership of PML-N was trying to woo MQM-P for an electoral alliance against Pakistan Peoples Party, the ruling party in Sindh, but the meetings failed to bear fruit. 
PML-N, with its traditional electoral symbol of tiger, has pitted candidates at 18 out of 22 National Assembly constituencies in the Karachi division, facing MQM-P on 17. 
On the rest of the four seats, the PML-N has supported Shah Owais Siddiqui Noorani of Jamiat Ulema Pakistan (JUP-Noorani) on one seat and Noorul Haq of Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl candidates on NA-239.
Meanwhile, MQM-P has fielded its candidates in all constituencies except for three seats in the National Assembly. One such constituency is the Lyari seat NA-239 where neither the PML-N nor the MQM-P has nominated a candidate and both are supporting Noorul Haq of JUI. Furthermore, seat adjustments are anticipated for the provincial seats PS-106 and PS-107 in the said constituency.
Lyari, a political hotbed, has PPP candidate Nabil Gabol, Tehreek Labaik Pakistan (TLP) candidate Sharjeel Gopalani, Jamaat-e-Islami's Fazlur Rehman Niazi, Central Muslim League candidate Hamza, and JDA candidate Shaista Ameer and others in the run. 
Abdul Shakoor Shad, who had defeated Bilawal Bhutto Zardari from Lyari on a PTI ticket in the 2018 general elections, was competing as an independent.
The candidates vying for the NA-229 Malir seat are MQM Pakistan's Fouzia Hameed, PML-N Qadir Bakhsh Kalmati, and ANP Sajid Mehmood. The candidates for the NA-230 Malir seat are Haji Muzafar Ali Shujra of the PML-N, Asif Ali of the ANP, and Muhammad Ali Shah of the JUI. This indicates that the PDM parties are running against one another in this constituency.

The Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) Aurangzeb Khan, the ANP's Abdul Qayyum, and the PML-N's Captain (retd) Jameel Ahmed Khan are also competing in the NA-231 Malir constituency. PPP, PML-N, and Imam Noorani (JUP-IN) are supporting Shah Owais Noorani on NA-232 Korangi against MQM-P's Aasia Ishaq.
In NA-233, Korangi, Zain Ansari of PML-N, and Javed Hanif of the MQM-P are face to face, while JUI and GDA have not fielded their candidates in this constituency. No seat adjustment took place between MQM-p and PML-N in the NA-234 Korangi seat either, where Amir Moin Pirzada of MQM-P and Senator Saleem Zia of PML-N are competing with each other. JUI and ANP have not fielded candidates in this constituency. However, Dilawar Gulzar of the GDA is in the race.
Sharafat Khan of the PML-N has been given a ticket in NA-235 East, whereas Muhammad Iqbal Khan is the candidate of MQM-P. On NA-236, Hassan Sabir of MQM-P, Syed Mushtaq Hussain of GDA and Parveen Basheer of PML-N are in the race.

In NA-238, candidates from GDA, MQM-P, PML-N and ANP face off against one another. The PML-N, GDA, and MQM-P candidates are competing for the seat of NA-240 South as well. PML-N and GDA have issued tickets to their candidates for the competition with Farooq Sattar in NA-241.
Khawaja Ghulam Shoaib of the PML-N and Arshad Sohail of the ANP are competing against Mustafa Kamal in NA 242 Keamari. On NA-243, MQM and PML-N are also in competition with one another.

As for the demography and ethnic makeup of the population, mostly Baloch, Pakhtun, Urdu, and Sindhi-speaking communities lives here in perfect harmony. Notable areas include Khaldabad, Gaddafi Town, Quaidabad, Labore Colony, Bhines Colony, Muslimabad, Gulshan Bunir, Sherpao Colony, the historic fishermen settlements of Ibrahim Hyderi, Lagi Goth, Juma Goth, Dawood Usman Goth, and others.
Several legal and illegal jetties for fishing operate here, yielding tons of fish and prawns daily. The influence of religious parties in NA-230 is strong, and the area is regarded as the abode of labourers and fishermen. The livelihood of thousands of people is linked to small and large industries. A significant portion of the population includes economic migrants from various cities who have taken up a temporary residence here. This is the reason only 31% of the population is registered to vote. As for economic background, most of the population comes from middle and lower middle class with a few affluent families. The country's largest milk market, named Bhens Colony, is also situated in this constituency. It supplies Karachi with daily milk, and several slaughterhouses fulfill a substantial part of the city's meat requirements.

The NA-230 constituency shares common urban challenges such as water scarcity, sewage overflows, and deteriorating roads. However, drug use and sales have been persistently hazardous issues. The labour hospital in the constituency faces inadequacies in serving patients effectively.
As many as 25 candidates are vying for the NA-230 seat, including PPP's Agha Rafiullah, PML-N's Haji Muzaffar Ali Shajra, ANP's Asif Ali, Jamaat-e-Islami's Muhammad Islam, JUI's Muhammad Wali Shah, TLP's Muhammad Anwar, and PkMAP's Abdul Razak. 
Apart from them, 16 candidates are contesting as independents, with PTI's Masroor Ali among them. In the 2018 elections, PPP's Syed Rafiullah secured victory in this constituency, though MQM-Pakistan has also tasted success here in the past.

• Move follows ‘malicious campaign’ against judiciary after PTI symbol verdict
• Team constituted under Peca includes officials from police, FIA, PTA and intelligence agencies
• PBC, SCBA back chief justice, decry undue criticism
• PTI slams lawyer bodies’ presser, insists Jan 13 judgement was ‘flawed’
ISLAMABAD: The car­e­taker government on Tue­s­day formed a five-member joint investigation team (JIT) to “ascertain facts behind a malicious social media campaign” against Supreme Court judges.
Meanwhile, the country’s premier legal bodies came to the aid of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and the Supreme Court against the backdrop of a “smear campaign” that erupted on social media soon after the Jan 13 judgement.
The JIT — formed under Section 30 (power to investigate) of the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016 — will be convened by the additional director general of the Federal Investiga­tion Agency’s (FIA) cybercrime wing, according to an interior ministry notification, seen by Dawn.
It also comprises representatives of the Intelli­gence Bureau, Inter-Serv­ices Intelli­ge­nce, the Pak­is­tan Telecom­m­u­nication Authority (PTA), and the deputy inspector general of Islamabad police. The team can co-opt any other member if required.
The notification, signed by FIA Deputy Secretary Muhammad Ziaul Haq, said the JIT’s terms of reference would be to “ascertain facts behind malicious social media campaign attempting to malign the image of the honourable judges of the Supreme Court”.
The committee will also identify and bring culprits to book in accordance with relevant laws, present challans in relevant courts and recommend measures to prevent such incidents in future.
“The JIT shall submit a preliminary report to the Ministry of Interior within a fortnight,” the notification said, adding that the FIA headquarters would provide support to the panel during the investigation.
The authorities did not identify any social media posts they deem part of the campaign.
 
 

After marathon hearings last week, a three-member Supreme Court bench headed by CJP Isa on Jan 13 upheld the Election Commission’s decision to revoke the PTI’s iconic electoral symbol, the cricket bat, and declare its intra-party polls “unconstitutional”.
PBC, SCBA back Justice Isa
Meanwhile, in a media interaction at the Supreme Court building in Islam­abad, officials of the Pak­is­tan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) backed CJP Isa amid renewed criticism following the Jan 13 judgement. They stressed that everybody had the right to criticise any judgement, but they would not tolerate the criticism of judges and the apex court using foul language.
The representatives who spoke on the occasion included PBC Vice Chair­man Haroonur Rashid; the chairman of its executive committee, Hassan Raza Pasha; senior member Qalbe Hassan; and SCBA President Shahzad Shaukat.
Mr Rashid asked senior lawyers not to use contemptuous remarks against judges and to exercise caution in their commentary on judgements while maintaining their respect.
 
 

Mr Shaukat lamented the tendency to initiate disparaging campaigns against judges and the courts. He insisted that passing fair comments on any judgement was acceptable, but mere criticism to bring the judiciary into disrepute should not be tolerated.
He said the SCBA had monitored all programmes on different TV channels after the Jan 13 judgement and concluded that no one could find holes in the verdict, but everyone was merely criticising the denial of the election symbol.
Referring to arguments that the top court could have given the benefit to the mainstream political party under Article 17 of the Constitution, a provision that talks about people’s right to form a political party, Mr Shaukat explained that constitutional rights were subject to and subservient to laws.
 


He said the lawyer bodies would take all possible measures to block with force the trend of unleashing a disparaging campaign against the judiciary.
Mr Pasha said both PBC and SCBA were on the same page in disseminating a clear message that the two bodies would not tolerate attempts to belittle the respect and prestige of the top judiciary and their adjudicators.
Qalbe Hassan of the PBC called for a representative convention of office-bearers of all the bar councils and associations of the country to take a joint stand against the tendency to malign the judiciary and the judges on social media after an unfavourable verdict.
This, he said, was essential to save democracy, which couldn’t survive if the highest judicial institutions like the Supreme Court were targeted with impunity in such a regrettable manner.
The officials also asked the PTA and the FIA that instead of becoming silent spectators, they should swiftly move by tracing social media accounts that generate such campaigns.
At the same time, the court should also initiate contempt of court proceedings against those found guilty of launching smear campaigns against judges, they said.
PTI flays ‘political presser’
Meanwhile, the PTI vehemently rejected the PBC and SCBA’s “political press conference”, saying it was part of the same scheme under which the door of free and fair elections had been closed by the Supreme Court upon 125 million voters of the country.
 
 

In a statement, a PTI spokesperson said the SC decision to strip the party of its electoral symbol was absolutely flawed and offensive and allegedly opened the door to a distortion in the constitutional and democratic scheme of the country.
He claimed that of the 175 political parties in the country, the PTI conducted the most effective and transparent intra-party elections. He said the party conducted two intra-party polls — on June 8, 2022, and Dec 2, 2023 — on which the ECP could not raise any reasonable and legal objections.

KHYBER: Amid extensive deliberations between government officials and traders on Tuesday to find an amicable solution to visa restrictions imposed on Afghan transporters, the Afghan Taliban authorities threatened to permanently close down the Torkham and Kharlaachi borders with Pakistan if a mutually agreeable solution was not found to the lingering issue.
Sources at Torkham told Dawn on Tuesday on condition of anonymity that the flag meeting between Pakistani and Afghan border security officials, held on Monday evening, ended on a sour note, with the Afghan Taliban refusing to continue the dialogue process if their Pakistani counterparts did not come up with a mutually agreeable solution to the visa policy issue for Afghan transporters.
They said that Afghan authorities had flatly conveyed to Pakistani security officials that the new restrictions were not acceptable to them as they were not given any prior formal intimation of the implementation  of the visa policy.
 
 

It was also learnt that Afghan authorities had demanded their Pakistani counterparts allow all Afghan transporters stranded on Pakistani soil to go back to their country, after which they would close the border permanently by erecting a concrete wall at the main gate.

New visa restrictions not acceptable to Afghan Taliban, Pakistani officials told

Border closure
Meanwhile, the Torkham border crossing remained closed for all types of trading activities for a fourth consecutive day on Tue­s­day, with some of the fruit-laden vehicles opting to return to Pesha­war for fear of their merchandise rotting due to a prolonged delay in the opening of the border.
Earlier in the day, a delegation of local traders and members of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industries (SCCI) held a meeting with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa caretaker chief minister retired Justice Arshad Hussain and conveyed to him the fallout of the sudden imposition of visa restrictions.
Zahidullah Shinwari, a former SCCI president, told Dawn that the delegation suggested the caretaker CM to defer the implementation of the new visa policy for at least two months to enable the maximum number of Afghan transporters to complete the process of acquiring valid travel documentation.
He said the chief minister was not only informed about the financial losses local transporters and traders had suffered due to the closure of the border, but also that Pakistan was in serious danger of permanently losing the Afghan market for its various export merchandise.
Mr Shinwari said the chief minister assured the team of his ‘who­l­e­hearted’ support in conveying their grievances to the federal government, but at the same time expre­s­sed his inability to make any cha­nges in the visa policy on his own, as it was not a provincial subject.
Also on Tuesday, another meeting was held between senior customs and security officials which discussed in detail the current situation both at Torkham and Kharlaachi border.
Customs officials had been ins­i­s­ting that the requirement for legal travel documents was imp­lemented the world over, with Pakistan and Afghanistan being no exception.
They said the Afghan authorities were conveyed about the imposition of the visa policy several times, but Kabul had failed to take any practical steps to adhere to international border crossing rules.
The immigration official at Torkham also said the new policy would help them keep track of all the people frequently traveling on both sides of the border.

QUETTA: Iran laun­ched attacks in Pakistan on Tuesday targeting what it described as bases for the militant group Jaish al-Adl in the border town of Panjgur in Balochistan, the Iranian state media reported, prompting strong condemnation from Islamabad.
“Two key strongholds of the Jaysh al-Dhulm (Jaish al-Adl) terrorist group in Pakistan” were “specifically targeted and successfully demolished by a combination of missile and drone attacks”, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency said.
 






Jaish al-Adl has previously mounted attacks on Iranian security forces in the border area with Pakistan. Tuesday’s attack in Balochistan came a day after Iran’s elite Revo­lutionary Guards attacked targets in Iraq and Syria with missiles.
Pakistan strongly condemned the unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that the strike inside Pakistani territory killed two children and injured three girls.
“This violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty is completely unacceptable and can have serious consequences,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday night. The statement didn’t mention the location of the attacks.
Tasnim reported that the “focal point of this operation was the region known as Kouh-Sabz (green mountain)” in Balochistan.
Local authorities said they had also received information about such an attack, but had no further details at the time of going to print. Reports from the area suggested that a missile hit a mosque, partially damaging it and injuring some people.
In its statement, the foreign office described the incident as an “illegal act”.
It said a strong protest had been lodged with Tehran, while the Iranian charge d’affaires had been called to MoFA to convey “strongest condemnation of this blatant violation”.

There seems to be no end in sight for the sufferings of the Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) as the party, after a likely bumpy ride in the Feb 8 elections, will have to face a tough time in keeping its elected ‘independent’ members in line and under control throughout the tenure of the next National Assembly.
Erstwhile PTI Chairman Barris­ter Gohar Ali Khan had already hinted at the possible difficulties the party might face after the elections when he expressed the fear that the court’s decision could incr­ease the likelihood of “horse-trading”.
He had made the statement while talking to reporters after the Supreme Court upheld a decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) revoking PTI’s ‘bat’ symbol.
 
 

PTI candidates will now contest the elections as independents with different electoral symbols. The decision has also deprived the PTI of its right to nominate its members on reserved seats for women and minorities.
Mr Khan’s fear seems to be justified, as in the past, the country has witnessed independent lawmakers making bargains many-a time on the occasion of elections for the prime minister and chief ministers, as well as speakers and deputy speakers of the assemblies. Besides,  independents have also resorted to ‘blackmail tactics’ at the time of voting on many crucial bills to get their way.

Party members will become ‘independent’ lawmakers, defection clause will not apply to them

In an interview with Geo News, Barrister Gohar reportedly expre­ssed the hope that independent candidates affiliated with the PTI would remain loyal to it, stating that the party also had a ‘Plan C’ for regaining its lost reserved seats.
He then explained that if independent candidates affiliated with the PTI joined the party again after it reformed itself, then the party would regain its reserved seats.
 
 

PTI’s Information Secr­e­­tary Rauf Hassan, when contacted, said the party had prepared a plan to keep its elected members within the party discipline. He, however, refused to disclose the plan.
A source in the PTI later claimed that the party leadership had decided to obtain affidavits from the elected members that they would not defect to the party at any stage and would continue to vote in the assemblies in line with the party leadership’s decision.
He added the party had given tickets only to the loyal members after thorough scrutiny in the wake of the defections it had already faced after the May 9 incident.
Defection clause
Parliamentary and political experts also believe that the PTI may not be able to control its members in the upcoming assemblies as the defection clause, Article 63-A, will not apply to them.
 
 

They say that these members, even if remain loyal to their party and do not join any other party within three days of their notification of victory, will be considered as independents throughout the five-year tenure of the assemblies.
According to Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Trans­parency (Pildat) president Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, the Election Rules 2017 are quite explicit in this respect. For independent legislators joining a political party to give that party the advantage of claiming proportionate reserved seats, he said, Rule 94 defined the political party as the one which had been allotted a symbol.
“If the party has obtained a symbol by then and the party has nomination papers filed for reserved seats, a case may be made for claiming its share of reserved seats. However, one may interpret that to qualify for reserved seats, a party should contest the general elections on a common symbol,” he said, adding that he believed that the matter would ultimately revert to the Supreme Court for conclusive adjudication.
According to Mr Mehboob, independent members can join any party at any time during their term or form a new party but in order to be counted for giving weightage to a parliamentary party, they must join the party within three days of final notification of their membership.
 
 

Similarly, former ECP secretary and Punjab Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Kanwar Dilshad, when contacted, said the PTI could go for fresh intra-party elections and satisfy the ECP after the general polls, but the PTI-backed candidates would not be able to join the party.
He said the law prescribed time for independents to join a party, and if they didn’t, they would remain independents thro­u­­ghout their five-year term.
“So there is no way, the PTI can make up for the loss of reserved seats”, he said, adding the independently elected lawmakers can form groups in respective houses with whichever name.
Rule 92(6) of the Election Rules 2017 provides for independents to join a party within three days if they want to be counted in calculation for the share of reserved seats for each party.
It states: “The expression ‘total number of general seats won by political party’ shall include the independent returned candidate or candidates who may duly join such political party within three days of the publication in the official gazette of the names of the returned candidates.”
It further says that “the consent of the independent candidate so delivered to the Commission shall, in no circumstances, be open to recall or cancellation.”
According to Mr Mehboob, once independents join a party, the defection clause will apply to them as it would apply to any other member. He said once they joined a party within three days, they became a member of that party and the defection clause leading to their de-seating would be applicable.
When asked about the possibility of forming a separate group in the assembly by these independents after winning the elections, he said that since the new group would not have contested the election under a common symbol, they wouldn’t be able to claim reserved seats as well as a share in the standing committees.
The Pildat chief said in the prevailing conditions, independent legislators might fall prey to horse trading unless the party commanded moral control over its affiliates.
He said the PML-N also faced such a situation in the Senate when quite a few of its senators were made ‘independent’ by a very “unfair SC judgement but I don’t think any senator defected”.

ISLAMABAD: In spite of a protracted crackdown on his political party, former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday appeared buoyant about its electoral prospects, saying the PTI will spring a ‘surprise’ on Feb 8 through its ‘Plan C’, which is ready after the failure of its so-called ‘Plan A’ and ‘Plan B’.
The PTI founder made these remarks during a conversation with reporters at Adiala Jail, who had gathered to cover the proceedings of cases, including the cipher case, underway against him in prison.
Mr Khan did not elaborate on what he meant by Plan C, but a day earlier, former PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan had said that the said plan revolved around retaining the reserved seats of the party following the loss of their electoral symbol, ‘bat’.
 
 

‘Plan B’ was ostensibly a deal the PTI had signed with its splinter group, ‘PTI-Nazriati’, to contest polls under the ‘batsman’ symbol, which was thwarted by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

Ex-PM says his party being condemned for May 9 riots without ‘solid proof’; LHC reserves decision on his nomination papers

On Tuesday, the PTI founder said that the party leadership knew that conspirators would spoil their plans, therefore, they had worked out alternative strategies.
He claimed that a conspiracy was hatched against the PTI government, adding that about 10,000 workers of the party were put behind bars and efforts to dismantle the political party were also in full swing. He said that as the founder of the PTI, whose political struggle spanned over 27 years, he was facing multiple charges along with his spouse Bushra Bibi.
Cipher issue
He also talked about the cipher issue, saying former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa offered him a two-thirds majority to keep quiet on the cipher issue and warned him of consequences if he tried to highlight the issue in public.
He said that Gen Bajwa had made the offer during meetings held at the President’s House, provided he  (Imran) would “behave sensibly and would not underscore the cipher issue”.
PTI’s founding chairman said that his party was being targeted over violence on May 9. He further alleged that the violent protests targeting the Corps Commander House and the GHQ were a part of the ‘London agreement’ and claimed that the PTI was not behind this mess.
Mr Khan denied a news report that he hurled threats to the members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and warned them of proceedings for high treason.
Nomination papers
Separately, a Lahore High Court full bench on Tuesday reserved its verdict on two petitions of Imran Khan, challenging the decisions of the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-122, Lahore and NA-89, Mianwali.
 
 

Mr Khan’s nomination papers were rejected primarily on the grounds of being convicted in the Toshakhana case. His nomination papers from NA-122 were also dismissed on the grounds of the proposer not being a voter from the constituency.
Advocate Uzair Bhandari argued on behalf of Mr Khan that the conviction on the charge of moral turpitude did not fall under the definition of disqualification. He said the conviction of the petitioner could not be equated with the conviction for corruption or accumulating illegal assets.
He pointed out that an Indian court enlisted the offence of moral turpitude lower than the offence involving financial corruption. However, the bench observed that the standards of morality in Pakistan were different from other regions.
He argued that the returning officer (RO) had no jurisdiction to pass the impugned order on the basis of the conviction on moral turpitude. He stated that the Islamabad High Court had already suspended the sentence of the petitioner. A lawyer for the ECP argued that the conviction of the petitioner was still in force and he had not been acquitted by the high court.
Toshakhana case
Meanwhile, senior counsel Sardar Latif Khosa on Tuesday requested for an early hearing of an appeal seeking to set aside Aug 5, 2023, his three-year conviction awarded by the trial court to PTI founder Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case.
Senior counsel Sardar Shahbaz Khosa had made a verbal request before a three-member bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, which was hearing a different case.
At this, the CJP regretted that on the one hand, the counsel was seeking relief from the court but on the other, he did not pose confidence in the courts and hurled allegations outside the court.
The CJP suggested to the counsel to move an application for the early hearing of the case and the court would grant any relief if the law necessitated it.

Differences between the Federal Board of Revenue chairman and Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar over restructuring of the tax machinery persisted, as the Inland Revenue Service on Tuesday contemplated going on a strike across the country.
Both the finance minister and the FBR chairman have not been able to resolve the differences with only two days left in meeting a deadline set by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) about submitting a summary for the cabinet.
The SIFC on Jan 3 had in principle approved the FBR’s administrative and legal restructuring and instructed the finance minister to take a summary to the federal cabinet within 15 days for approval.
The FBR chairman has submitted a draft of the summary to the finance minister but there are issues between the top two decision-makers.
There are also differences between the Customs Service Group -the junior partner- and the Inland Revenue Service -the group controlling the FBR administration.
The SIFC had approved to separate the policy function of the FBR and place it with the Revenue Division. It also approved to abolish the FBR and establish two new boards, the Federal Customs Board and the Federal Board of Inland Revenue.
Sources said that the finance minister wanted the chairman of each board to be from the private sector. But the FBR chairman wanted a government servant to head the board due to the nature of the work.
Read SIFC steps in to end differences over gas price hike
This difference is becoming a hurdle in the finalisation of the summary for the cabinet along with many other sticking points. If the difference persists, the summary might have the dissenting views of the finance minister and the FBR chairman and the matter would then be decided by the cabinet.
The caretaker prime minister is currently visiting Switzerland to attend the Annual World Economic Forum Meeting. Once the summary lands in the cabinet and is approved, it would lead to triggering a host of amendments in multiple laws and rules. However, there is one strong view that it is not the mandate of the caretaker government to unleash such drastic restructuring just three weeks before the elections.
But the Customs Department sees these three weeks the only window where they can be separated from the influential Inland Revenue Service Group.
The matter would also be discussed today (Wednesday) at the Senate Standing Committee on Finance, to be chaired by PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
The FBR’s field formations of Inland Revenue Service on Tuesday contemplated to go on an indefinite strike with effect from 11am against the restructuring. However, the senior FBR management was trying to convince the service to postpone the strike for a few days. Last Friday, the Large Taxpayers Office Karachi observed a token strike against the restructuring, which the officers now wanted to be spread to all 25 offices across Pakistan.

The sources said that the Customs Department had its own set of reservations. The FBR chairman proposed to place the functions of the human resource management, directorate of valuations and the International Taxes with the Revenue Division. But the customs officers were against these proposals.
The SIFC had been informed that the purpose of the FBR’s restructuring was to enhance revenue collection, strengthen governance and accountability, separate policy function to ensure sustainable economic growth and transparency and introduce better oversight mechanisms with steeper accountability.
The Tax Policy Board will be headed by the finance minister and will include experts in taxation, tax policy division and tax administration, economists, and industry experts with no conflict of interest.
The Revenue Division’s mandate will include political coordination across federal and provincial tax matters. It will work to promote revenue and tax policy coordination. The division will also be responsible for integrity policy frameworks, strengthening the tax appellate bodies and modernising the legal and regulatory framework.Functions of the two new boards
The government would appoint the director generals from the Inland Revenue and Customs Groups. The director generals will be the heads of the respective establishments for a fixed tenure.
They will be accountable to the respective oversight boards and will act as principal accounting officers for their respective administrations.
Each board would comprise 10 members – four from the public and six from the private sectors.
The Torkham border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan remained shut for the fourth consecutive day on Tuesday, as a flag meeting between the officials from both sides regarding visa restrictions for the drivers of cargo vehicles remained inconclusive.
Pakistan has made visa mandatory for the drivers of commercial vehicles entering the country from Afghanistan. The measure aimed at improving security, preventing smuggling, and promoting legal bilateral trade.
Because of the closure, hundreds of cargo vehicles were stuck on both sides of the border. At the same time, Pakistan was also losing an average of Rs50 million per day in the form of revenues. For the opening of the border crossing, Pakistani and Afghan officials held a flag meeting, but their talks remained inconclusive.
Security officials said that the federal government imposed the visa requirement for drivers of Afghan cargo vehicles on Nov 1, 2023. The Afghan government was given two-and-a-half-month time to implement the policy.

However, they added, the Afghan authorities did not show any seriousness towards the measure as drivers coming from the other side did not carry their travel documents. The government implemented the visa policy four days ago and stopped the drivers without visas from entering the country.
Qari Nazeem Gul and Kharij Khan, who import and export fresh fruits and vegetables, said that due to the closure of the border crossing, their perishable commodities on more than 100 vehicles had been lost, incurring losses to the tune of tens of millions of rupees.
A customs official, while speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the Pakistan-Afghan bilateral trade generated Rs50 million revenues per day on average. Torkham Transport Union President Haji Azimullah said that a cargo vehicle cost more than Rs15 million.
Azimullah said that the vehicles were taken by the transporters on instalments, adding that the border closure for four days not only affected the tyres and engines of the vehicles, but also dented the earning of the labour, who did not get paid during that period.

A flag meeting was held between Pakistan and Afghan security officials on the border issues at the Torkham Frontier Corps (FC) conference hall. During the meeting, the Pakistani forces stressed that they could not back down from the federal government’s decision of not allowing Afghan drivers entry without visa.
The Pakistan security officials added that the Afghan authorities were not serious in providing the data of their drivers and did not force their drivers to produce travel documents. They stressed that the measures were necessary to prevent smuggling and promote bilateral legal trade.
In response, the Afghan authorities maintained that obtaining Pakistani visa was impossible for Afghan drivers. After the announcement of the new measures, Pakistan had taken special measures for two-way traffic at the Torkham border.
Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) Chairman Jahangir Tareen on Tuesday pledged to prioritize youth employment and adopt a forward-looking strategy to address the nation's challenges if his party secures power in the February 8 elections.
The IPP chief was speaking during a corner meeting at the residence of the former tehsil nazim Syed Asghar Shah Geelani.
Reposing trust in the people of Lodhran, Tareen noted that the residents of the city gave him respect, adding that it was his responsibility to serve them to “pay back their debt”.
He said after casting their ballots, the voters would acknowledge that they had chosen the “right party”.
The IPP leader maintained that with the passage of time his inclination towards work increased. “The name Lodharan will be heard throughout Pakistan if the people help us succeed,” he said.
Taking a dig at PTI’s founding member Imran Khan, Tareen stated that “everything changed” when the former became the premier.

I started a new party since I had been working for them (PTI) day and night for 10 or 12 years, he said, adding that the prime minister’s seat was a “dangerous thing” while noting that a “monarch thinks that he is everything”.
In a veiled reference to the powers that be, Tareen observed that the individuals who had “appointed him (Imran) as prime minister are likewise forgotten”.
Expressing his resolve to alleviate the burden of masses, the IPP leader emphasized the importance of a forward-looking approach, casting aside the shadows of bygone days.
“Now we have to look into the future. We now need to think about the nation. If Pakistan grows, Lodhran and its people will also grow. Countries are not run like they were run in previous eras,” he said.
“The economy of the country is strong. Providing jobs to the youth will be our first priority. Pakistan should be respected in the world. We have to think for Pakistan,” he added.
Tareen also held meetings with party leaders and workers.
Candidates for PP-228 constituency Nazir Khan Baloch and Syed Asghar Shah Geelani also spoke on the occasion.
 
Despite the announcement of solidarity by superior bars, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa is losing support from one section of lawyers—the Professional Lawyers Group. The Independent Lawyers Group, also known as the Asma Jahangir Group, holds the majority in the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA).
Currently, this group is aligned with the PML-N, the PPP, and the security establishment. It played a key role in the successful no-confidence motion moved against former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan under Article 95 of the Constitution in March 2022.
The Professional Lawyers Group, which is pro-PTI, is in the minority in both superior bars. However, when the PTI-led government filed a presidential reference against Justice Isa in May 2019, both lawyer groups united in support of the judge.
The leadership of the Professional Group—Muneer A Malik, Salahuddin Ahmed, and Hamid Khan—were even part of Justice Isa's legal team. Hamid Khan had openly criticized PTI’s policy towards Justice Isa. However, members of the Professional Group are now expressing disappointment at the Supreme Court’s January 13 verdict, which dealt a heavy blow to the former ruling party by depriving it of its iconic election symbol—the cricket bat.

They believe the court order will have far-reaching implications for democracy, and the credibility of the upcoming elections is now at stake. PBC member Muneer Kakar, associated with the Professional Group, expressed wonder as to how the SC could deprive citizens of their constitutional right by knocking out one political party on technical grounds.
Meanwhile, the Independent Group demanded that the caretaker government take action against those running a malicious campaign against CJP Qazi Faez Isa. Responding to the call, the federal government has formed a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe into the campaign.

CJ Qazi Faez Isa has been facing a malicious campaign on social media since the filing of a presidential reference against him in 2019. Even state institutions were allegedly involved in defaming the judge and his family members. Interestingly, the then-government remained silent on that campaign.
Now, when state institutions require the SC's help to counter the PTI, a JIT is being formed to please SC judges, especially CJP Isa. It is noteworthy that despite facing severe criticism, Justice Isa’s predecessor Umar Ata Bandial had shown restraint.
Some senior lawyers believe that the JIT might have chilling effects on freedom of speech. They said CJ Isa needs to ensure that the JIT is not used to target those who are not in the good books of the establishment. Those who troll judges are on good terms with powerful circles, they claimed.
Interestingly, the JIT will not investigate campaigns launched against high court judges. There is a need to find out the mastermind behind the campaign against Islamabad High Court judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and the Peshawar High Court judges who recently gave relief to the PTI in the election symbol case, they added.
ISLAMABAD: Calling out its seemingly contradictory stance, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa on Tuesday noted that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) displayed distrust in the judiciary while simultaneously seeking relief.
He made the remarks while a three-member was addressing pending cases when PTI’s lawyer Latif Khosa unexpectedly approached the rostrum to request that the application against former prime minister Imran Khan’s disqualification in the Toshakhana case be scheduled for a hearing.
CJP Isa, responding to Khosa's plea, quipped, "Latif Khosa saheb, you go out and make accusations. On the one hand, you do not trust the judiciary; on the other hand, you also ask for relief."
The CJP added that relief would be granted according to the law.
It is pertinent to note that earlier, PTI withdrew its petition seeking contempt proceedings against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), alleging the ECP's failure to ensure a level playing field for the upcoming elections.

The party had filed the plea on December 26, 2023, but decided to withdraw it during the court hearing.
Khosa had informed CJP Isa that PTI would take the matter to the “people's court” rather than pursuing it within the judiciary. He lamented that the January 13 verdict, which deprived PTI of its 'bat' symbol, forced the party to refrain from contesting on more than 230 seats.
In response, CJP Isa questioned Khosa about the continuation of the case, to which Khosa explained that he had been directed to withdraw the plea. He criticised the apex court for "shattering the PTI's level playing field," arguing that the forced independent candidacy of all PTI candidates would create confusion among voters.
However, PTI appears poised for a countermove. Sources earlier told The Express Tribune that the party is gearing up to challenge the top court’s order, with a review petition in the works.
Some legal experts find themselves perplexed by the party's seemingly contradictory stance. While PTI openly expresses mistrust in CJP Isa, its legal team prepares for a review petition—scheduled to appear before the same bench led by CJP Isa.
 
In a major twist, PTI Senior Vice Chairman Sher Afzal Marwat on Tuesday said he would continue the polls campaign in Sindh – hours after he called it off claiming that he was “attacked” by party leaders Raoof Hasan and Hamid Khan.
In a post on social media platform X, Marwat wrote that he would not be distracted and urged the PTI activists to “deal [with] all the satanic forces” on their own. On Sunday, Marwat launched the PTI’s election drive in Sindh but later announced calling it off because of the statements against him by “sick-minded people” like Hamid and Hasan.
“Why these people are targeting me? Did I ever talk against them? I am so disheartened and feel so dejected. We were [supposed] to hold conventions in Sanghar and Nawabshah today but after being attacked by my own party senior lot, I am cancelling all my programmes and events,” he wrote on X.
However, earlier he had described President Arif Alvi of the PTI as a “wrong number”. In videos on social media, he had claimed that Alvi’s son had applied for a PTI ticket but he had opposed the move. Marwat maintained that Alvi had “conspired” against the party.
In response to this statement, PTI’s Hasan, while speaking to a private TV news channel a day earlier, claimed that Marwat did not reflect the party’s position and had no post within it. He added that the PTI “did not own” Marwat’s statements.

Hasan also denied that Marwat met with PTI founding chairman Imran Khan in jail, saying that the deposed premier was only permitted to meet his legal team, sisters and wife. He claimed that no political leader of the PTI had been allowed to meet the party’s founding chairman.
Likewise, PTI’s Hamid -- in a video circulating on the social media – maintained that he did not “recognise” Marwat. He added – similar to what Hasan had said – that Marwat was not representing the party.
Hamid also ruled out internal disputes within the PTI, adding that there were two to three people estranged members, who were trying to create a conflict within the party. However, talking to the media outside Adiala Jail, PTI stalwart Barrister Gohar Ali Khan clarified that Marwat was still a part of the party.
He continued that Marwat would contest the upcoming elections from Lakki Marwat and be victorious. Gohar urged PTI members to set aside their personal differences as he announced that the finalisation of the list of candidates was just around the corner. Conceding that challenges persisted within the PTI, he described internal disagreements as an inherent aspect of the democratic process.

With the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) beset by misfortunes, former Punjab governor Chaudhry Sarwar, who joined this party last year with hopes of not only carving out his own political career but also working things around his new party, is inching his way towards the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), sources said on Tuesday.
Sarwar, who had previously been part of PML-N and PTI, joined PML-Q in May last year when the party was reeling from the exodus of former Punjab chief minister Pervez Elahi along with all the party’s then MPAs from Punjab.During his time in PML-Q, Sarwar attempted to breathe new life into the party by recruiting leaders from various backgrounds, though none were particularly prominent.
Sarwar, given that he served two terms as governor and his own interest in constituency politics developed during his governorship, was anticipated to take a leading role in steering the party.However, this could never happen as decision-making control within PML-Q remained firmly in the hands of Chaudary Shujaat’s family.According to sources, it was this lack of his input in decision-making, that forced Sarwar to reconsider his political choices.
Read  Two former MQM leaders join PPP
The source revealed that Sarwar opposed aligning with the PDM, believing that distancing the party from PML-N would enhance its chances of winning over voters.Sarwar had conveyed to Shujaat and his sons that supporting the PDM government would hinder their chances of winning. However, the PML-Q chose stay in the government and enjoy their ministries.Sarwar recently held two meetings with PPP leadership. The first meeting took place earlier this week when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited his house to offer condolences on the death of his brother Chaudhry Ramzan Pervez.
Sarwar held another meeting with PPPP President Asif Ali Zardari at Bilawal House Lahore on Tuesday.According to the information provided to the media, Sarwar had extended his support for Bilawal Bhutto for NA 127 elections.The source also disclosed that in the coming days, Sarwar would formally announce his decision to join PPP.He mentioned that the reason behind this was PML-Q had no scope of making any comeback, which meant that if Sarwar contests elections post-April, when the bar on him ends, he will get no advantage of being in that party.He stated the main reason is that PPP can provide Sarwar an opportunity to become a senator.
Defying the odds of floods and financial constraints, Pakistan Railways has steamed into the current fiscal year with raking in Rs41 billion, which is 46% or Rs13 billion more than the earnings in the corresponding period of last year.
This upsurge in revenue in the first six months of 2023-24 can be attributed to a multi-pronged approach adopted by the railways authorities. Passenger traffic played a major role, contributing Rs24 billion, while the freight sector chipped in with Rs11 billion. Other departments also fetched Rs5.5 billion.
The number of operational trains has also seen a boost, with 96 passenger trains plying the tracks compared to 86 last year. The freight trains have also witnessed a similar increase, with the average daily trains running from 3.75 freight trains last fiscal to seven this fiscal.
Addressing concerns about employees’ salaries, officials have assured that the issue has been resolved and will streamline further once the Mainline-I (ML-I) project gains momentum.

Inflationary pressures and rising fuel costs have necessitated fare hikes in both passenger and freight segments, a move expected to bolster revenue in the coming months.
Safety remained a top priority, with a drastic decrease in passenger train accidents reported. Only six minor incidents, with no casualties, occurred on the entire network in the last three months, according to a railways ministry official.
"Only two train accidents have taken place in September, no accident happened in October and four train accidents occurred in November due to effective steps of the department,” he said. “The drastic decrease in accidents has been witnessed due to the efforts being undertaken to reduce trespassing at unmanned level crossings and unauthorised locations, he added. 
The cash-strapped government of Pakistan has announced that it will borrow a record Rs9.44 trillion from domestic commercial and Shariah-compliant banks, an amount needed to repay some of the maturing debt and finance expenditures over three months ending July 2023.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the government will acquire massive funds to repay old debt of Rs8.05 trillion. As a result, it will add a net Rs1.38 trillion over three months to the total domestic public debt, which has grown to “unsustainable levels.”
Market talk suggests that Rs9.44 trillion is the single largest bank financing being availed of by the government but it cannot be confirmed officially till the filing of this report.
Arif Habib Limited economist Sana Tawfik said the government set such a huge borrowing goal in the wake of growing reliance on domestic debt following the choking of foreign loans due to the stalled International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme since November 2022.
She said the latest addition to net debt would widen the government’s fiscal deficit. “Fiscal account is facing mounting pressure for two major reasons which include continuous piling up of domestic debt and the surge in interest payments after a hike in key policy rate to record high at 21%.”
Both things – domestic debt and interest cost – “have grown to unsustainable levels over a period of time.”
Total domestic debt soared to Rs38 trillion as of December 31, 2022, which constituted 45% of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 53% of total public debt (including external liabilities).
Debt servicing (mark-up cost) on domestic debt is estimated at close to Rs5.6 trillion in the current fiscal year 2022-23, which is equal to 76% of the tax revenue collection by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
According to Tawfiq, at present the government has two options: to create some fiscal space to give a significant push to the national economy or restructure the public debt. “It can cut non-development expenditure and enhance tax revenue receipts by increasing the number of taxpayers.”
The restructuring, however, is difficult. It carries high solvency risks for some domestic banks. Moreover, there should be the option of liquidity supplies from the central bank and the IMF must be on board as well.
The third option would be to pay off debt through printing new currency notes but it would further increase inflation in the country, she added. Inflation is already running at a six-decade high at 36.4%.
At present, banks are offering financing at a historically high mark-up of 22% in the backdrop of the surge in central bank’s key policy rate to 21%.
Moreover, the breakdown of central bank data shows the government has targeted to borrow Rs7.50 trillion by selling three to 12-month treasury bills (T-bills) during May-July 2023. It aims to borrow another Rs1.49 trillion via auction of two-year to 30-year Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) at fixed and floating rates.
Additionally, it intends to acquire financing of Rs450 billion by selling Sukuk to Shariah-compliant banks over three months.
The government is scheduled to pay Rs7.08 trillion for the maturing T-bills mainly in installments around June 2023. It also has to pay off Rs647 billion for the maturing long-term PIBs in May to July.

The risk of a US default is adding to problems facing the slowing global economy, with rising interest rates and high debt levels already choking back investments needed to fuel higher output, World Bank President David Malpass said on Friday.
Group of Seven (G7) finance officials meeting in Japan discussed the “very high importance” of raising the US debt limit and averting the negative repercussions of a potential default on US government debt for the first time ever.
“Clearly, distress in the world’s biggest economy would be negative for everyone,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of the G7 meeting. “The repercussions would be bad to not get it done.”
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday reiterated that failure by Congress to raise the $31.4 trillion debt limit would result in economic and financial catastrophe, and urged the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to agree to lift the federal debt limit.
Malpass said there had been discussion during the G7 meetings about the need to boost productivity and growth, and also deal with a high debt overhang.
Global growth was slated to fall below 2% in 2023, and could stay low for several years, he said. One of the big challenges was that advanced economies had taken on so much debt that it would take a lot of capital to service it, leaving too little investment for developing countries, he said.

The Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) has cautioned the government of Pakistan that restrictions on internet services can have a knock-on effect on credit and investment plans, ultimately damaging the country’s reputation.
Powers to restrict services should be exercised carefully solely in exceptional and pre-defined circumstances, and only if absolutely necessary and proportionate to achieve a specified and legitimate aim that is consistent with relevant laws, internationally recognised human rights conventions and the ITU constitution, it said.
In a letter written to Minister of IT and Telecom Syed Aminul Haque, GSMA Head of Asia-Pacific Julian Gorman raised serious concern over the restriction of connectivity and internet services in Pakistan.
GSMA, which represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, was concerned about the impact that the current restrictions were having on citizens and businesses in Pakistan, GSMA said, adding that in today’s digital societies, individuals and businesses relied on connectivity for their livelihoods and access to essential services and information.
It said that prolonged restrictions could have far-reaching effects on citizens’ health, education, social and economic welfare.
The GSMA urged the government to restore access and it stood ready to engage constructively, wherever support required, to improve the process and ensure business continuity, Gorman added.
Freelancers and owners of e-commerce websites operating in Pakistan have faced a huge loss as they have not been able to connect to their clients due to internet connectivity issues.
Leading digital marketer Tanveer Nandla voiced concern over the suspension of internet services and requested the government to immediately lift the restrictions.
He said that prolonged internet disconnection would result in bad reputation for the freelancers working in Pakistan.
“Pakistani freelancers and digital marketers had built trust in the international market and were bringing billions of dollars into market. The distrust may result in losing the freelancing market,” he feared.
The nationwide suspension of mobile broadband has caused an estimated revenue loss of Rs820 million while the government has lost around Rs287 million in tax revenue. 
In a tweet, Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim said that shutting down the internet “is not a solution to anything. It creates more problems than it solves.” He stressed that the devastating effect on the economy was quantifiable but the inconvenience to people was incalculable.
Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) Chairman Muhammad Zohaib Khan said, “Internet is our lifeline, our office, our communications infrastructure and the IT industry can’t operate without it. IT & ITeS services are already under a lot of pressure on account of stagnation and experiencing a probable decline in the exports of IT services due to the bad governmental policies; and, now the political turmoil has completely stopped the IT industry’s operations.”

US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told lawmakers her department could start repurchasing oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after completing a congressionally mandated sale next month.
“That congressionally mandated sale of 26 million barrels will be completed by June, and it’s at that point where we will flip the switch and then seek to purchase,” Granholm told lawmakers in a hearing in the US House of Representatives.
The Biden administration last year conducted the largest ever sale from the SPR of 180 million barrels. That and other sales last year have pushed the reserve to about 372 million barrels, the lowest since 1983.
Granholm previously said the Energy Department could start buying back in the fourth quarter after maintenance on two of the reserve’s four sites on the coasts of Texas and Louisiana.
The administration has said it will buy oil when prices are consistently at or below $67 to $72 per barrel. US crude prices fell more than 2% on Thursday to settle at $70.87 a barrel.
Granholm’s comments “reflect an intense messaging campaign likely intended to mollify Republicans angry about the big SPR draws,” said Bob McNally an energy policy analyst at Rapidan Energy. Granholm’s comments also likely seek to dissuade OPEC+ from cutting supply again, he said.
OPEC+ last cut output in April, a surprise move of about 1.15 million barrels per day. Oil prices fell on Friday and were set to end the week lower for the third straight week, as the market balanced supply fears against renewed economic concerns in the US and China.

Lauding the efforts of industrialists for establishing a new industrial zone and constructing an expo centre in the capital, he assured them of the government’s cooperation for materialisation of the two projects.
He called the schemes very important that would give a boost to industrialisation and improve trade and exports.
Qamar welcomed the plan and announced his assistance for launching an FM Radio for the business community to educate them about matters like trade laws, regulations and importance of exports.

In yet another turn that has further eroded chances for revival of the $6.5 billion bailout package, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to now arrange $8 billion in fresh loans to back the external debt repayments during the next seven months.
The IMF’s demand to seek its approval on the upcoming budget for fiscal year 2023-24 has also not been met yet, further minimising the prospects of an early completion of the pending 9th review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), according to the government sources.
Sources say that the IMF has raised the demand for additional financing from an earlier unmet condition of $6 billion to $8 billion aimed at ensuring debt repayments coming up for the May-December 2023 period.
The lender has worked out the $8 billion needs by considering all projected inflows and outflows for this period.
Pakistan, however, has not accepted the new additional financing demand on the grounds that the Fund’s current programme will end in June 2023 and it should not put conditions beyond the programme period.
In February this year, the IMF had asked Pakistan to arrange $6 billion in fresh loans, excluding rollovers and refinancing to meet debt repayments until June 2023 and to stop the further depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Due to a delay in arranging these funds, the 9th programme review worth $1.2 billion remains incomplete.
On Monday, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told the executive director of the IMF that Pakistan had met all the prior actions. Saudi Arabia has promised to give $2 billion while the United Arab Emirates has committed $1 billion in fresh loans.
According to the sources, the finance minister informed the executive director that the remaining $3 billion can only be arranged once the IMF announces staff-level agreement and the board approves the ninth review along with the $1.2 billion tranche.
The IMF resident representative did not respond to a query about whether Pakistan needs to arrange $8 billion from now until December this year to meet external debt repayment requirements.
In a scheduled press conference on Thursday, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack, said Pakistan needed “significant additional financing” to successfully complete the ninth review. She said the economy was facing stagflation, had very large financing needs and had also been affected by a series of shocks, including severe flooding.
Obtaining commitments of “significant additional financing” is essential before the IMF approves the release of pending bailout funds that are crucial for Pakistan to resolve an acute balance of payments crisis, according to the IMF spokeswoman.
Sources have said that the IMF’s focus is now more on ensuring that Pakistan does not default by arranging funds to the extent of the external debt repayments. It is no longer emphasising on increasing the extremely low foreign exchange reserves.
Dar also said on Thursday that Pakistan would not default on any foreign liability, with or without an IMF programme. He said Pakistan had fulfilled all the prior actions of the IMF and it was now up to the lender to sign the agreement.
The finance minister argued that the delay in the IMF deal should not be linked to default.
“Pakistan will not default whether there is an IMF programme or no programme,” he asserted. He went on to say that additional tough decisions could not be taken at this stage.
Dar said that suspicions were being created as if to say that Pakistan is going to default on its international payments. He said an international rating agency talked about Pakistan’s $3.7 billion external payments due before June 30 and when he responded to the situation with a clarification, another rating agency came up with an assertion the next day that Pakistan would not be able to meet its foreign obligations from July to December.
The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan have fallen to $4.4billion.
The government has been trying to avoid default by putting the brakes on imports, as its debt-related financial inflows have almost dried up due to a delay in reaching a deal with the IMF.
Sources say that the government is also not inclined in meeting the IMF’s demand of sharing a draft of the next year’s budget. Senior officials from the finance ministry said that the draft budget can only be shared if the IMF is willing to merge the 10th review and give more than $1.2 billion financing tranche.
Of the $6.5 billion, $2.6 billion still remain undisbursed despite a nine-month extension in the IMF programme.

Finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies discussed the need to make global supply chains more resilient by reducing over-reliance on China, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Friday.
Japan, which is hosting a three-day G7 meeting to debate key global themes in the city of Niigata, has been leading fresh efforts to diversify supply chains away from China by building partnerships with low- and middle-income countries through investment and aid.
Countries such as Germany wanted to reduce its dependency on China, Lindner told a press conference. “Here, emerging and low-income countries come into play,” he added.
But while the G7 rich democracies are likely to agree on the partnership deal to beef up supply chains, they are not on the same page in terms of how far they should go in countering China - the world’s second largest economy that is not a G7 member.
The US is at the forefront in pushing for stronger steps. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for targeted controls in investment to China to counter what she saw as Beijing’s “economic coercion” against other countries.
While wary of China as a strategic rival, Germany is cautious, however, of being seen as forging a G7 front against Beijing given its heavy reliance on trade with the country.
Japan is also sceptical about the idea of investment controls due to the huge impact such a move could have on global trade and its own economy, government officials say.
British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt told the Nikkei newspaper on Thursday the G7 must counter China’s economic coercion, though made no mention of investment controls.
Hanging over the meeting was a lack of progress in resolving a US debt ceiling stalemate.
The G7 nations can little afford further risks to their fragile economies and there were some voices of concern raised over the potential dire consequences if the US were to fail to resolve the impasse, which could tip its economy into recession.
A scheduled meeting on Friday between US President Joe Biden and top lawmakers was postponed until early next week
Germany’s Lindner said he hoped US politicians would come to a “grown-up” decision on talks to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling - the maximum amount the US government is authorised to borrow.
World Bank President David Malpass told Reuters the risk of a US default added to problems already facing the global economy that was entering a prolonged period of slow growth.
“It looks like global growth will fall below 2% this year in 2023, but then, as you look at future years, it may stay low for several years,” due to rising borrowing costs and high levels of debt, Malpass said on Friday in Niigata.
The G7 finance leaders are expected to issue a joint statement after their three-day meeting ends on Saturday.

The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has completed the 500kV Thar-Matiari Transmission line in a record time of two and a half months, meeting the directive of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The 220-kilometre-long transmission line was completed at a cost of approximately Rs15 billion using the company’s own resources.
This project is vital for future energy needs, as it will connect coal-fired power generation in Thar to the rest of the country. The transmission line will connect the 1320 MW SECL coal plant in Thar to the Matiari Converter station, improving the country’s power transmission system.
The completion of the Thar-Matiari transmission line marks the second project completed by NTDC this year, despite several challenges. The Polan-Jiwani transmission line, which aimed to import 100 MW of electricity from Iran for Gwadar, was also completed by NTDC in record time.
To ensure the project’s timely completion, 54 individual crews consisting of over 300 labourers worked relentlessly. A camp office of NTDC’s top management was also set up at Mithi (Thar) near the project site to monitor the pace of work.
The completion of this project is a significant step towards energy security and development. It will bring much-needed relief to the country’s power sector and help meet its growing energy demands. The NTDC’s successful completion of the project in record time reflects its commitment to delivering critical infrastructure to the country.

In a letter written to Minister of IT and Telecom Syed Aminul Haque, GSMA Head of Asia-Pacific Julian Gorman raised serious concern over the restriction of connectivity and internet services in Pakistan.
GSMA, which represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, was concerned about the impact that the current restrictions were having on citizens and businesses in Pakistan, GSMA said, adding that in today’s digital societies, individuals and businesses relied on connectivity for their livelihoods and access to essential services and information.
It said that prolonged restrictions could have far-reaching effects on citizens’ health, education, social and economic welfare.
The GSMA urged the government to restore access and it stood ready to engage constructively, wherever support required, to improve the process and ensure business continuity, Gorman added.
Freelancers and owners of e-commerce websites operating in Pakistan have faced a huge loss as they have not been able to connect to their clients due to internet connectivity issues.
Leading digital marketer Tanveer Nandla voiced concern over the suspension of internet services and requested the government to immediately lift the restrictions.
He said that prolonged internet disconnection would result in bad reputation for the freelancers working in Pakistan.
“Pakistani freelancers and digital marketers had built trust in the international market and were bringing billions of dollars into market. The distrust may result in losing the freelancing market,” he feared.
The nationwide suspension of mobile broadband has caused an estimated revenue loss of Rs820 million while the government has lost around Rs287 million in tax revenue. 
In a tweet, Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim said that shutting down the internet “is not a solution to anything. It creates more problems than it solves.” He stressed that the devastating effect on the economy was quantifiable but the inconvenience to people was incalculable.
Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) Chairman Muhammad Zohaib Khan said, “Internet is our lifeline, our office, our communications infrastructure and the IT industry can’t operate without it. IT & ITeS services are already under a lot of pressure on account of stagnation and experiencing a probable decline in the exports of IT services due to the bad governmental policies; and, now the political turmoil has completely stopped the IT industry’s operations.”

US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told lawmakers her department could start repurchasing oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after completing a congressionally mandated sale next month.
“That congressionally mandated sale of 26 million barrels will be completed by June, and it’s at that point where we will flip the switch and then seek to purchase,” Granholm told lawmakers in a hearing in the US House of Representatives.
The Biden administration last year conducted the largest ever sale from the SPR of 180 million barrels. That and other sales last year have pushed the reserve to about 372 million barrels, the lowest since 1983.
Granholm previously said the Energy Department could start buying back in the fourth quarter after maintenance on two of the reserve’s four sites on the coasts of Texas and Louisiana.
The administration has said it will buy oil when prices are consistently at or below $67 to $72 per barrel. US crude prices fell more than 2% on Thursday to settle at $70.87 a barrel.
Granholm’s comments “reflect an intense messaging campaign likely intended to mollify Republicans angry about the big SPR draws,” said Bob McNally an energy policy analyst at Rapidan Energy. Granholm’s comments also likely seek to dissuade OPEC+ from cutting supply again, he said.
OPEC+ last cut output in April, a surprise move of about 1.15 million barrels per day. Oil prices fell on Friday and were set to end the week lower for the third straight week, as the market balanced supply fears against renewed economic concerns in the US and China.

In yet another turn that has further eroded chances for revival of the $6.5 billion bailout package, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to now arrange $8 billion in fresh loans to back the external debt repayments during the next seven months.
The IMF’s demand to seek its approval on the upcoming budget for fiscal year 2023-24 has also not been met yet, further minimising the prospects of an early completion of the pending 9th review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), according to the government sources.
Sources say that the IMF has raised the demand for additional financing from an earlier unmet condition of $6 billion to $8 billion aimed at ensuring debt repayments coming up for the May-December 2023 period.
The lender has worked out the $8 billion needs by considering all projected inflows and outflows for this period.
Pakistan, however, has not accepted the new additional financing demand on the grounds that the Fund’s current programme will end in June 2023 and it should not put conditions beyond the programme period.
In February this year, the IMF had asked Pakistan to arrange $6 billion in fresh loans, excluding rollovers and refinancing to meet debt repayments until June 2023 and to stop the further depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Due to a delay in arranging these funds, the 9th programme review worth $1.2 billion remains incomplete.
On Monday, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told the executive director of the IMF that Pakistan had met all the prior actions. Saudi Arabia has promised to give $2 billion while the United Arab Emirates has committed $1 billion in fresh loans.
According to the sources, the finance minister informed the executive director that the remaining $3 billion can only be arranged once the IMF announces staff-level agreement and the board approves the ninth review along with the $1.2 billion tranche.
The IMF resident representative did not respond to a query about whether Pakistan needs to arrange $8 billion from now until December this year to meet external debt repayment requirements.
In a scheduled press conference on Thursday, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack, said Pakistan needed “significant additional financing” to successfully complete the ninth review. She said the economy was facing stagflation, had very large financing needs and had also been affected by a series of shocks, including severe flooding.
Obtaining commitments of “significant additional financing” is essential before the IMF approves the release of pending bailout funds that are crucial for Pakistan to resolve an acute balance of payments crisis, according to the IMF spokeswoman.
Sources have said that the IMF’s focus is now more on ensuring that Pakistan does not default by arranging funds to the extent of the external debt repayments. It is no longer emphasising on increasing the extremely low foreign exchange reserves.
Dar also said on Thursday that Pakistan would not default on any foreign liability, with or without an IMF programme. He said Pakistan had fulfilled all the prior actions of the IMF and it was now up to the lender to sign the agreement.
The finance minister argued that the delay in the IMF deal should not be linked to default.
“Pakistan will not default whether there is an IMF programme or no programme,” he asserted. He went on to say that additional tough decisions could not be taken at this stage.
Dar said that suspicions were being created as if to say that Pakistan is going to default on its international payments. He said an international rating agency talked about Pakistan’s $3.7 billion external payments due before June 30 and when he responded to the situation with a clarification, another rating agency came up with an assertion the next day that Pakistan would not be able to meet its foreign obligations from July to December.
The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan have fallen to $4.4billion.
The government has been trying to avoid default by putting the brakes on imports, as its debt-related financial inflows have almost dried up due to a delay in reaching a deal with the IMF.
Sources say that the government is also not inclined in meeting the IMF’s demand of sharing a draft of the next year’s budget. Senior officials from the finance ministry said that the draft budget can only be shared if the IMF is willing to merge the 10th review and give more than $1.2 billion financing tranche.
Of the $6.5 billion, $2.6 billion still remain undisbursed despite a nine-month extension in the IMF programme.

Finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies discussed the need to make global supply chains more resilient by reducing over-reliance on China, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Friday.
Japan, which is hosting a three-day G7 meeting to debate key global themes in the city of Niigata, has been leading fresh efforts to diversify supply chains away from China by building partnerships with low- and middle-income countries through investment and aid.
Countries such as Germany wanted to reduce its dependency on China, Lindner told a press conference. “Here, emerging and low-income countries come into play,” he added.
But while the G7 rich democracies are likely to agree on the partnership deal to beef up supply chains, they are not on the same page in terms of how far they should go in countering China - the world’s second largest economy that is not a G7 member.
The US is at the forefront in pushing for stronger steps. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for targeted controls in investment to China to counter what she saw as Beijing’s “economic coercion” against other countries.
While wary of China as a strategic rival, Germany is cautious, however, of being seen as forging a G7 front against Beijing given its heavy reliance on trade with the country.
Japan is also sceptical about the idea of investment controls due to the huge impact such a move could have on global trade and its own economy, government officials say.
British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt told the Nikkei newspaper on Thursday the G7 must counter China’s economic coercion, though made no mention of investment controls.
Hanging over the meeting was a lack of progress in resolving a US debt ceiling stalemate.
The G7 nations can little afford further risks to their fragile economies and there were some voices of concern raised over the potential dire consequences if the US were to fail to resolve the impasse, which could tip its economy into recession.
A scheduled meeting on Friday between US President Joe Biden and top lawmakers was postponed until early next week
Germany’s Lindner said he hoped US politicians would come to a “grown-up” decision on talks to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling - the maximum amount the US government is authorised to borrow.
World Bank President David Malpass told Reuters the risk of a US default added to problems already facing the global economy that was entering a prolonged period of slow growth.
“It looks like global growth will fall below 2% this year in 2023, but then, as you look at future years, it may stay low for several years,” due to rising borrowing costs and high levels of debt, Malpass said on Friday in Niigata.
The G7 finance leaders are expected to issue a joint statement after their three-day meeting ends on Saturday.

The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has completed the 500kV Thar-Matiari Transmission line in a record time of two and a half months, meeting the directive of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The 220-kilometre-long transmission line was completed at a cost of approximately Rs15 billion using the company’s own resources.
This project is vital for future energy needs, as it will connect coal-fired power generation in Thar to the rest of the country. The transmission line will connect the 1320 MW SECL coal plant in Thar to the Matiari Converter station, improving the country’s power transmission system.
The completion of the Thar-Matiari transmission line marks the second project completed by NTDC this year, despite several challenges. The Polan-Jiwani transmission line, which aimed to import 100 MW of electricity from Iran for Gwadar, was also completed by NTDC in record time.
To ensure the project’s timely completion, 54 individual crews consisting of over 300 labourers worked relentlessly. A camp office of NTDC’s top management was also set up at Mithi (Thar) near the project site to monitor the pace of work.
The completion of this project is a significant step towards energy security and development. It will bring much-needed relief to the country’s power sector and help meet its growing energy demands. The NTDC’s successful completion of the project in record time reflects its commitment to delivering critical infrastructure to the country.

The Islamabad High Court )IHC) has surprised the PDM-led government by granting extraordinary relief to Imran Khan who himself and other party leaders were not expecting it.
Consequently, experts believe that with the help of superior judiciary, Imran has emerged victorious in this round of clash with powerful circles.
One political analyst says that rescuing Imran in difficult times by the superior courts is a big setback for the security establishment as well as the civil government, which is already unpopular among the masses on account of inflation.
The first relief was given by the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial declaring that execution of the arrest warrant issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman dated May 1, 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case within the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against Imran was invalid and unlawful.
The manner in which the bench dealt with Imran during the hearing had profound implications on every court of the country, including the IHC.
Likewise, extra courtesy shown to Imran by CJP Bandial has also invited the government functionaries’ criticism.
One federal minister believes that issuance of orders in favour of Imran by the IHC is the outcome of the SC proceedings.
The IHC held that Imran would not be arrested in criminal cases registered against him on or after May 9 or MPO etc.
However, there are several other reasons of granting extraordinary relief to Imran, which cannot be overlooked.
Firstly, the IHC is known to grant relief in matters related to civil liberties for the last four years.
One section of lawyers say that arrest of Imran was also mishandled by the government authorities.
One lawyer refers former CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry case wherein the police had manhandled him on the road.
On account of that incident, the judiciary united against that establishment led by General (retd) Pervez Musharraf.
Similarly, the law enforcement agencies arrested Imran within the IHC premises without the permission of the registrar.
Friday’s IHC order in favour of Imran may be the outcome of the manner in which he was arrested from within the court premises.
The IHC judges’ remarks also suggest that they were visibly annoyed the way sanctity and dignity of the court was violated by Rangers.
A lawyer says that the IHC judges through judicial orders in favour of Imran on Friday sent a message to those who violated the sanctity and dignity of the court.
Even IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq had stayed the trial court proceedings against Imran in the Toshakhana case.
Earlier, the two judges’ judicial order was uploaded on the IHC website in the Tyrian White case.
Despite the IHC orders, the PDM leadership has decided to protest against the SC led by CJP Bandial on Monday.
Political analysts say that the purpose of this protest is to put pressure on the SC which may pass an order regarding the violation of April 4 order to hold elections on May 14.
However, sources revealed to The Express Tribune that senior PTI leaders are also uneasy over Imran’s anti-establishment stance, especially his statement against the incumbent army chief.
It is learnt that Imran has limited the consultation process with senior leadership on such issues.
Even senior party leaders were surprised when Imran had asked the negotiation team to leave the dialogue process, if the government did not dissolve the National Assembly on May 14.
Even the government side was willing to dissolve the assembly in the first week of July.
Special Assistant to Prime Minister Jawad Malik says that it’s a triumph for mob violence and arson and a loss for law and order.
"The state and establishment properties and personnel were brazenly targeted. Imran Khan’s swift release reinforces the PDM stance that the judiciary is partisan", he adds.
Senior lawyers say that the game is not yet over.
“If SC delays the Punjab Assembly elections for any reason, the PDM government as well as the establishment will not have been defeated.”
 
Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Saturday gave the relevant authorities 72 hours to identify and arrest all those involved in rioting after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan’s arrest this week sparked deadly violence.
The prime minister said the cases would be tried by anti-terrorism courts. "All available resources including technological aid and intelligence are being deployed to chase down these elements. Bringing these people to justice is a test case for the government," the prime minister said while chairing a meeting at the Punjab Safe City Authority Headquarters in Lahore.
The PTI chairman’s arrest in a land fraud case on Tuesday, which the Supreme Court ruled "invalid and unlawful" on Thursday, sparked violent protests by his supporters. They stormed military establishments, set ablaze a state broadcaster building, smashed buses, ransacked a top army official's house and attacked other assets, resulting in the army being deployed in multiple cities.
More than 2,800 arrests were made, while 152 police officers were injured, 74 police vehicles vandalised and set on fire, and 22 government buildings, including police stations and offices, were damaged, said the Punjab police. At least eight people were killed in the violence.
Following the prime minister's announcement, the Punjab caretaker government released pictures of unidentified protesters involved in an attack on a military official's residence on Wednesday.
The prime minister said that it was a “critical task that requires swift action to ensure the safety and security of our citizens”. “I am setting a target for all responsible culprits, planners, instigators, and attackers to be apprehended within the next 72 hours.
During the meeting, the prime minister said that the “law will take action against those who have made plans and attacked the police". “The law will take action against them so that an exemplary precedent is set, demonstrating that those who act against the cherished homeland and the institutions that constantly risk their lives to defeat enemies will face consequences,” he added.
The prime minister further said that any attempts to disrupt peace and stability of our nation was "absolutely unacceptable", adding that this is a critical moment that required our unwavering commitment. “We must act decisively and without delay. It is a matter of utmost urgency, and failure is not an option,” he maintained.
The premier added that the culprits will be apprehended and cases will be filed against them in Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs) in accordance with the law and Constitution.
“I have requested an increase in the number of ATCs to ensure swift and efficient proceedings. We are determined to take all necessary measures, even if it means conducting proceedings at night, to ensure justice is served and the rule of law prevails.”
The prime minister stated that the ATCs should begin work immediately without any delay. “It is crucial to set an example that no terrorist or enemy will dare cast an ill eye upon Pakistan’s institutions until the day of judgement,” he said.
The prime minister added that he has also requested caretaker Punjab chief minister Mohsin Naqvi to ensure that those responsible for the unrest were arrested and brought to court.
On his Twitter handle, the prime minister said that he had given the law enforcement apparatus, a target of 72 hours to arrest all those involved in facilitating, abetting and perpetrating the disgraceful incidents of arson, ransacking, sabotage and damaging public and private properties.
He said all available resources including technological aid and intelligence were being deployed to chase down these elements.
“Bringing these people to justice is a test case for the government. Their cases will be tried by the anti-terrorism courts,” he further posted in his tweet.
Also, the prime minister said Imran Niazi was responsible for the barbaric act of torching of Corps Commander House in Lahore as he planned and instigated the act of arson.
Talking to media during his visit to Jinnah House, he said the planners, instigators and abettors behind this attack will not be given any relief.
He said Jinnah House was the home of Corps Commander Lahore which on May 9 was tragically and cruelly burnt.
The rioters attacked and set the house on fire, he said, adding the arsonists did not care that it was a historical building and the army officer and his family were living there.
Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif visits CMH Lahore and meets officers and soldiers injured on 9th May during the violent protests. Lahore, 13th of May, 2023.The building was inhabited by the son who was on duty to protect his motherland, he remarked. “This was a cruel and anti-state act which never happened before in the 75 years history of the country.”
The prime minister said he was saddened while talking about the incident and said nobody thought that such an incident could happen.
The head of the nation was bowed with shame and it was grieving after this episode, he added.
He said those who perpetrated this act would be brought to justice and they would be dealt with the iron hand of constitution and law and would be given exemplary punishment according to law and the world would remember their fate for a long time to come.
Shehbaz said the barbaric act was committed against those sons of the soil who were eradicating terrorism for maintaining peace in Pakistan.
It was an act against those who sacrifice their lives to protect our borders and their wives become widows and their children become orphans, he added.
While during his visit to Combined Military Hospital and Services Hospital Lahore, he inquired after the well-being of the officers including DIG Operations Ali Nasir Rizvi and jawans who were wounded while performing their duties during rioting.
Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi and senior army and civil officers accompanied the prime minister.
 
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has claimed to have restored internet access following the release of former premier Imran Khan, but many people have reported slow or non-existent internet connections.
The government has not given any clear reason for this, leading to confusion and frustration among citizens. The PTA spokesperson denied purposeful slow speed of the internet.
However, the recent events surrounding the arrest and subsequent release of Imran had an adverse effect on the country’s internet and social media platforms.
While the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) claimed to have opened up the internet, it has not been fully restored, leading to complaints from people struggling to access the internet and social media.
Even though the internet resumed on Friday, social media sites are still not working properly on both mobile phones and desktops, startup investment specialist Kapeel Kumar said.
“This situation is still creating chaos and leading this nation towards disappointment,” he said. Right now, most of the apps are not accessible without VPN and the internet is very slow on mobile data and fiber as well, he added.
Imran’s arrest on corruption charges caused a massive uproar in the country. The arrest led to protests, clashes with law enforcement agencies and attacks on military installations. To control the situation, the interior ministry directed the PTA to shut down broadband, causing an unforeseen impact on the country’s economy and general life.
As of now, the internet situation in Pakistan remains sluggish, and many people are still unable to connect to social media or other sites.
Internet speed has been reported to be as slow as 3G, with frequent disconnections, making it difficult for people to carry out even the most basic online tasks.
In today’s age, businesses rely on the internet to manage their operations, ICT analyst at JS Global, Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia said.
The burgeoning startup and freelance industries in Pakistan are also dependent on a stable internet connection.
“Such small businesses and freelancers suffered greatly from internet outages during the outgoing week,” he said.
Due to the lack of internet access in Pakistan, Fiverr, a renowned global marketplace for freelancers, temporarily disabled the accounts of Pakistani freelancers, which does not present a positive image in front of the world, he said.
Internet users are still complaining of limited bandwidth when trying to access social media, despite not officially being blocked anymore.
The slow internet speed had a considerable impact on people’s daily lives. Many students rely on the internet for online classes, which have become a norm since the start of the pandemic. It has been a significant hurdle for those who need to study for exams or access educational materials.
The slow internet speed has also severely impacted business and the economy. Online businesses have been hit hard, with some unable to operate at all due to slow internet speeds. Those who can still operate are experiencing severe disruptions, which have resulted in lost revenues and customers.
The government has been criticised for its handling of the situation, with many people accusing it of not doing enough to address the isue.
There has been widespread frustration and anger at the lack of clear communication from the authorities, which has left people in the dark about what is going on.
 
PTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan on Saturday demanded an independent investigation into the vandalism and violence that broke out during the protests in the aftermath of his arrest by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, under the supervision of the Supreme Court.
The PTI chief also urged his supporters to come out of their homes and gather at a spot in their neighbourhood from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm on Sunday (today) with placards inscribed with “Save Constitution, Save Country” and once again announced to kick off a series of public rallies from Muridke, Punjab from May 17 (Wednesday).
In in his first address to the nation from Lahore after his release from NAB’s custody, the former premier called for an investigation into the protests and vandalism that occurred following his arrest on May 9, asking Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial to lead the investigation and "personally" chair the panel.
“I want an independent and complete investigation into the burning of state buildings and firing at unarmed youth protesters. I want CJP Umar Ata Bandial to constitute a panel under him for this purpose.”
Imran denied the involvement of his party workers in the nationwide violent protests and attacks on the military installations, including the Lahore Corps Commander House and the General Headquarters (GHQ).
He asserted that those who provoked violence during PTI protests were not “their people”, claiming that “these miscreants” instigated the people to act violently.
He reiterated that his supporters always remained peaceful during their 27-year struggle.
The PTI chief recalled that he had called off sit-in in Islamabad last year, as he wanted to avert violence. “When I was shot [in Wazirabad], should not there have been vandalism? This did not happen, because I do not believe in violence. PTI is the only political party in the country where families, including children, attend public gatherings and why they would ever want anarchy in the country?” he asked.
“I was told to set up a militant wing for my party if I wanted to build PTI in Karachi, as the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and other parties had armed wings. This was 25 years ago. I told them (powers that be) the day you include armed men in your party, its nature changes, and thus, I refused,” he said.
The former premier accused the coalition government for mayhem, saying those who feared elections wanted anarchy in the country and not his party. “And those who fear [polls] will be destroyed in elections. They want chaos,” he added.
While extending gratitude to the judiciary for “saving him” from going to jail, he castigated PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif for “destroying” the judiciary’s independence in the past. “When an independent judiciary is destroyed, your independence comes to an end with it, because the judiciary protects your fundamental rights.”
The PTI chairman observed that democracy was hanging by thread and only the judiciary could save it, adding that “this mafia is going all out in attacking the judiciary”.
He urged the nation to stand with the judiciary and the Constitution.
Imran condemned the manner in which he was arrested from the Islamabad High Court on May 9, saying the army, which should not have come to apprehend him, assaulted him.
He noted that on Friday the police stopped him for leaving the IHC premises despite the court granted him bail in multiple cases.
“The police wanted to arrest me under MPO (Maintenance of Public Order) outside the courtroom,” he claimed.
In his defence against the NAB case, Imran claimed that he did not reap any personal benefit from Al-Qadir Trust, saying that a “trustee never gets any monetary benefit”.
He said the decision to establish a university was taken in November 2018 and that its groundbreaking ceremony was held when he was the premier in May 2019.
“The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA)’s case surfaced seven years after that and it was taken up in the cabinet in December 2019. At the time, the funds for the university had already been allocated,” he said.
“The case was quite simple. We were given a choice that Pakistan would receive $170 million from NCA and its details regarding the agreement would remain confidential or otherwise we [would] have to file a case in the UK. We were also told that we had already wasted $100 million on foreign litigations and if we file a case, it will take years to conclude. Hence, we decided that if $170 million come to the Supreme Court or to the government, it would come to Pakistan. Instead, the government made a corruption case against me over this,” he said.
Imran said the aim to establish Al-Qadir University was to produce leadership for the country, which was acquainted with Islamic teachings.
He lambasted the recently sacked NAB chairman as well as the “handlers” for incorporating his wife’s name in the case.
Imran fired broadside at the country’s military establishment for "jumping into politics", suggesting that it should form its own political party.
He vented out his frustration over what he called “baseless allegations” levelled by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) against him and his party.
"Never has ISPR said such things. You should be ashamed of yourself. You have jumped into politics. Why don't you make a party for yourself," he said.
"I am trying to restrain myself [here] as I am very angry at your allegations since you don't know what you are talking about."
“DG Sahib, I had represented my country and brought prestige to it when even you were not even born,” he said while addressing the DG ISPR and added, “you should know who defended the Pakistan Army at the international forums during the war on terror”.
The PTI chairman went on to say that he did not use derogatory words for the army chief, asking “how could you (DG ISPR) level allegations against me”.
He averred that he was not responsible for the economic meltdown in the country. “If I criticise someone, it means I want reforms.”
Imran continued that the army was maligned because of the former army chief’s actions who not only “stabbed him in the back but also imposed a corrupt mafia on the country”.
“The nation is not a herd of animals that acts as the army chief desires,” he said.
“The DG ISPR does not have the right to call me a liar or deceptive person.”
Imran stressed that nobody could eliminate a political party by force and put them in jail.
“I know you (army chief) would not listen to me but my suggestion for you is to come out of small, closed rooms and see how you could save the country from destruction.”
The PTI chief also claimed that he knew the names of all those who planned his assignation last year.
“I know that a plan was devised to kill me. I know the names of all the actors involved in it, from top to bottom. I know who gave the green light and colluding with them were two civilians: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah,” he added.
Five members of a family were killed and four others critically injured when a vehicle plunged into a ravine in the Shangla district on Friday.
Police told The Express Tribune that the incident took place on Sanila Link Road.
“The family is resident of Ragishom and they visited Sanila to attend a marriage ceremony. On their way back home the vehicle went out of the control of the driver due to speeding and plunged into a deep ravine, killing five and injuring four more,” said a police official when approached.
All the injured were rushed to hospital by local residents on self-help basis.
“All the injured and dead were taken to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Alwach and the injured were later referred to Saidu Sharif,” he said, adding that careless driving in the hilly region often results in deadly accidents.
He said that a majority of the vehicles that travel along these steep and winding roads are often not in optimal condition, and went on to mention that the driver of the vehicle involved in the crash was also severely injured.

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Caretaker Chief Minister Azam Khan has said that special efforts are needed to bring the newly merged tribal districts of the province on a par with the rest of the country.
He indicated that the matter concerning the allocation of the tribal districts’ share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, as well as other dues owed to the province, has been brought to the attention of the prime minister. It is expected that a resolution to this issue will be reached in the near future.
The chief minister announced that to resolve the public issues of the newly merged districts, he will reserve every Thursday for meeting with tribal people and to listen to their issues personally.
In this regard, the first session of meetings was held on Thursday at the Chief Minister House Peshawar in which a delegation of tribal elders from different merged districts apprised the chief minister of their issues related to health, education, communications, and other service delivery sectors. They also submitted written applications to him.
The CM on this occasion issued directives to departments concerned for immediate resolution of public issues in these districts and warned that no negligence will be tolerated in this regard.
The tribal elders expressed their gratitude for the decision and expressed optimism that it would bring about a swift resolution to their problems. 
They lamented that in the past, tribal districts had been consistently overlooked and neglected, resulting in the tribal belt being one of the most underdeveloped regions in the country, where basic necessities such as education, healthcare, and job opportunities were lacking.
The delegates said that this initiative of the chief minister is a proof of his interest and seriousness in solving the problems of the tribal people.
While talking to the delegation, the chief minister said that people of the merged districts have rendered numerous sacrifices during the last four decades, adding that the caretaker government is aware of public issues of the tribal people and steps would be taken to resolve them on priority.
Azam Khan said that every step would be taken to develop the education and health sectors and improve the road network in the region by allocating funds for the purpose.
The CM has acknowledged the longstanding issues faced by the people of the merged districts and has pledged to take swift action to address them. To this end, priority measures will be put in place, and special meetings will be convened with relevant departments to ensure timely resolution of these issues. Additionally, special attention will be given to completing ongoing development projects within their designated timeframes.
The CM said that he has taken up the matter with the PM to get the share of the merged districts in NFC and will raise this matter again with the federal government. The people of the merged districts should get their constitutional and legal rights at all cost.

Police on Friday arrested a provincial minister of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Mubeen Khilji, for inciting violence following the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
Khilji is the provincial minister for industries and enjoys a good reputation in the PTI. He was arrested by police from Quetta.
Like other parts of Pakistan protests also started in Balochistan province after the dramatic arrest of Imran Khan during which PTI supporters torched public and private property.
A senior police official said Khilji was shifted to district jail Quetta. Khilji has been arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).
The Bijli Road Police Station also lodged an FIR against him for inciting violence which caused considerable damage.
So far, police have arrested 72 workers and leaders of the PTI in Balochistan for inflicting damage to public and private properties.
A day ago, former deputy speaker of National Assembly Qasim Khan Suri, provincial minister Mobeen Khilji and other PTI leaders were booked for inciting violence.
The Police Station Bijli Road in Quetta lodged an FIR against PTI leaders for inciting and directing violent protests in the provincial capital and other parts of Balochistan.
As per the FIR obtained by The Express Tribune, police accused Suri, Mobeen Khilji and other PTI leaders of inflicting damage to public and private property, blocking roads and burning tyres to disrupt routine life.
On Thursday, a senior police official said that so far police have arrested 70 workers and leaders of the former ruling party in Balochistan. All of the arrested PTI workers have been shifted to various police stations for interrogation.
Addressing a press conference, Munawara Munir, the former MNA of the PTI lashed out at the Balochistan government for what she claimed using force against PTI workers without any valid reasons.

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) police has launched a crackdown against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership involved in acts of arson, rioting and violent protests across the province.
Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaisar, his brother former MPA Aqibullah, former lawmakers Abdul Karim, Rangiz Ahmad, PTI district Swabi president Sohail Yousfzai, Swabi Tehsil Nazim Ataullah, former education minister Shahram Khan Tarakai’s brother Faisal Khan and around 200 PTI workers have been booked in Swabi district alone.
On Friday police withdrew security from the residence of Asad Qaisar. Police said that he had already been booked for rioting so no security will be provided to him.
Around 81 PTI workers have been arrested in Swabi and 61 of them shifted to Haripur prison.
“Police raided the residence of Shahram Khan Tarakai, Abdul Karim and others but they had already escaped,” said a police official while talking to The Express Tribune.
In Peshawar, former provincial minister Ishtiaq Urmar, former lawmaker Fazal Ilahi, Arbab Jehandad Khan, Malik Wajid and Asif Khan have been booked.
PTI sources said that police raided the houses of Malik Wajid, Haji Shaukat Ali, Arbab Sher Ali, Murad Saeed, and Aysha Bano.
PTI has also released the CCTV footage of police raids.
The party has threatened it will stage more protests if raids on the houses of PTI leaders and workers are not stopped.
PTI district president of Peshawar, Muhammad Atif Khan and Peshawar City head Irfan Saleem have announced that a protest will be launched if raids are not stopped.
In a video message, they said that police was raiding the houses of party workers and leaders without any rhyme or reason.
“Police are raiding houses without ladies police in order to please someone. They should respect the local culture and avoid doing such things,” he said.
They demanded of the caretaker chief minister to take notice of this and if he is helpless then resign from his post.
“Let us make it clear. If these raids are not stopped then it will be very difficult situation for all,” they said.

The provincial leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Shams Hamzazai on Thursday urged the mines and minerals department to ensure precautionary measures for avoiding tragic incidents in the mining sites.
Talking to APP, he said the government should take stern action against those mine owners who did not take precautions and safety measures in their mines. Shams said, “Mostly, the incidents occurred due to negligence of the labourers and mine owners without inviting any attention from the quarters concerned”.
He appealed to the government to bind inspectors to inspect the mines on a regular basis to overcome the rising disaster incidents and death ratio due to poor working conditions and awareness and impose a ban on those mines in the province which lack precautionary measures.
Hamzazai asked the labourers and mine owners to cooperate with the department in following safety and health protocols.
He urged the mine owners to instal safety equipment in mines for the protection of the coal miners.
“The department is responsible to create awareness among the workers and to organize training sessions for mine workers on a regular basis,” he added.
He said the main reason behind fatalities in the mining sector was a lack of oxygen and explosions due to methane gas.
Hamzazai urged the mine owners and workers to take the issue more seriously for making efforts to implement the law for overcoming coal mine incidents.
The mines and minerals sector of the province has witnessed a huge royalty collection and the potential to spur economic growth and job creation in Balochistan, he stressed.
The government should issue more licenses with the aim to trigger rapid growth of the mining sector and attract maximum investors, he maintained.
He added the government should establish new regional offices of mines and minerals at Muslim Bagh, Harnai, Mach and Gwadar to ensure good governance and facilitation of the mining companies.
Meanwhile expressing concern over the Duki coal mine accident that occurred last week, he said the coal miners were making efforts on their own to ensure the recovery of their companions who were trapped inside the coal mine.
At least two coal miners were trapped when a coal mine was suddenly filled with rainwater in the Duki mines area.

Sindh Transport and information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon informed the Sindh Assembly on Friday that around 50 acres of land of the Sindh Mass Transit and Public Transport Department has been encroached upon and converted into buffalo pens.
He alleged that the Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Shaikh has encroached upon the said property of the transport department.
“Madam, I request you to form a committee comprising opposition and treasury members to probe into the matter and get the land evacuated,” he said, addressing deputy speaker Rehana Leghari.
“The transport department has submitted a report,” Sharjeel said waving a copy of the report in his hand. 
When the transport department approached the land grabbers they agreed to evacuate only six to seven acres under a deal and wanted to retain the rest of the land under their control. 
GDA MPA Nand Kumar Goklani earlier raised the issue of land grabbing of the transport department in Sanghar district. 
During the debate on the issue, the Leader of the Opposition and PTI MPAs were not present in the house as cases of attacks and ransacking public properties were registered against them after Imran Khan’s arrest. 
Earlier, as the session started, Goklani moved his call attention motion on the rapid increase in the prices of daily-use commodities and questioned the performance of the bureau of supply and prices, which according to him is non-functional.
“Even after the bumper crop of wheat the price of flour has touched a new peak. Poor people can’t purchase milk, yogurt and fruits. The prices of daal and vegetables are out of the reach of the labour class. What action is being taken to control the prices and keep vigil on profiteers,” he asked. 
Minister for parliamentary affairs, Mukesh Kumar Chawla called the inflation an international phenomenon and said that the government had taken action against profiteers who were selling commodities at exorbitant prices. 
Street crimes
Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) MPA Abdul Rashid drew the attention of the house towards the rising street crimes in the city and said that 130 people have been killed in the last five months. “Around 72,000 vehicles have been stolen but the provincial government’s main focus is on the local bodies’ elections,” he said. 
Responding to him, Chawla said that the Sindh government has contained the law and order in Karachi and the situation was better as compared to the situation in the recent past. “There is an issue of street crime in some areas of Karachi. Police and law enforcement agencies are working on it,” he said. 
Rana Ansar of MQM asked the Sindh government minister about the budget allocated and utilized for technical education in 2022-23. “We have a large number of youth, who we have to train them with the latest vocational skills,” she said. 
Minister for higher education, boards and universities Ismail Rahu responded that around Rs1.5 billion has been allocated for technical education in Sindh, but funds have not been released due to floods and rains. “Most of the development funds have been diverted for flood relief and rehabilitation after last year’s monsoon that wreaked havoc in almost all Sindh districts,” he said. 
Later, the session was adjourned till Monday.

Sindh government spokesperson and CM's Adviser for Law Barrister Murtaza Wahab took a strong exception to the relief provided by the Supreme Court to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan.
Incensed like all other parties in the government, the PPP-led Sindh government spokesperson said, "is it written in the Constitution of Pakistan that no action will be taken against Imran Khan?"
Addressing a press conference at Sindh Assembly media corner on Friday, he said, "why was there a double standard for a person who does not believe in the system of Pakistan?" 
Having spent a lifetime in the courtrooms, Wahab said he had never heard a judge saying to a suspect 'Welcome Khushi Hui Aap ko Dekh ker'. PPP will celebrate victory in the local bodies' elections on Saturday (today), Wahab told the media.

Over a dozen marriage halls located in a residential area of Gulberg have been demolished during the night between Thursday and Friday by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) officials. 
The authorities claimed that notices were issued to the owners of the halls several months ago, but they went unanswered. The final notice was then issued, after which the halls were subsequently demolished.
According to reports, the SBCA staff, along with heavy machinery and a contingent of anti-encroachment force, local police, and rangers, reached the spot and took action against 14 marriage halls established from Water Pump Chowrangi to Cafe Piala in the Gulberg on Thursday night.
According to DC Central Taha Saleem, the action was taken on the orders of the Supreme Court, and it is aimed at addressing the issue of illegal marriage halls. Six months ago, notices were issued to the marriage halls’ owners, but they failed to comply despite receiving notices. The flow of traffic was also adversely affected due to these illegal marriage halls, and waste from wedding halls was being dumped into the sewage system, causing damage to the sewage system of the area. 
The operation was carried out by SBCA and anti-encroachment staff, while heavy machinery was used in the operation. However, initially, the personnel had to wait until late night as there were wedding ceremonies going on in some of the halls. 
Meanwhile, the area residents have expressed their relief, saying that the government should have taken this step 15 to 20 years ago. They said that the noise pollution from the wedding halls, including the bursting of firecrackers and gunfire, was causing significant problems for them and their children. The parking of cars by wedding guests in the streets was also causing significant inconvenience to the residents.
Moreover, residents of the area also demanded that coaching centres, schools, CNG filling stations, shops, marketing, and other commercial activities running on the street where marriage halls were established should be abolished in the same way. 
Waiters working in the marriage halls expressed their concern, stating that they had become unemployed due to the collapse of the marriage halls. They demanded of the government to provide them jobs.

Police claimed to have apprehended a suspect they said was member of a gang suspected of robbing a significant amount of money from a Turkish engineer in the jurisdiction of Saddar police station. 
Teken Matan was robbed by suspects in police uniforms on Abdullah Haroon Road on April 16.
Police managed to recover a vehicle and a police uniform during the operation; however, one of the gang's accomplices evaded capture and remains at large.
Incidently, the apparently forged number plate of the white sedan is BAD 164, while Pakistan Penal Code 164 stands for abetment in illegal gratification by a government official.
According to DIG South Irfan Baloch, the police had been closely monitoring the criminal group. Four policemen on two motorcycles were stationed at Daudpota Road in Saddar when they noticed two individuals behaving suspiciously in a car on Wednesday. The police officers attempted to stop the suspects, but they attempted to flee. A hot pursuit ensued, and the police fired at their vehicle’s tyres near Lines Area Parking Plaza, which led to the arrest of one of the suspects, Shahid, son of Ali Ahmed Kufar. Unfortunately, the other suspect managed to escape.
The arrested individual and his accomplice were responsible for the robbery on April 16. They forcefully took a bag of money from the Turkish engineer, Teken Matan, at Abdullah Haroon Road. The incident occurred while the engineer parked his car and walked towards a money changer. The assailants, dressed in police uniforms, assaulted him and fled with the money bag. A case has been filed at Preedi police station concerning the incident.

In a controversial move, several top officers of Sehwan Development Authority (SDA), including Planning and Development Control Director and Land Management Deputy Director, were relieved of their duties without any specified reasons. 
The notification stated that any official activity conducted by these officers from May 11 will be considered illicit and treated as null and void. The Director General of the SDA, Saeed Sualeh Jumani, who himself is facing controversies related to his pay scale and dual charges, assigned two officers to immediately get the office rooms vacated from the ten officers and take into custody all the official records, stamps, registers, ledgers, and official vehicles. Non-compliance will result in stern action, warned Jumani.
An official from the SDA, who requested anonymity, suggested that the reason for the removal of these officers might be related to their refusal to comply with Jumani's whims. It is alleged that Jumani, a BS-19 officer who has been given two BS-20 charges, acts as a full-fledged head of the SDA, despite only having been given the look-after charge.
The SDA's jurisdiction extends to near Karachi, and a number of housing schemes are being launched by Karachi-based builders and developers within the authority's jurisdiction. However, the Sindh government has failed to appoint a full-time DG in the SDA, and the Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA) is also being headed by an acting DG who is actually the deputy commissioner of Hyderabad.

China is trying to broker a ‘workable solution’ between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban to address the issue of banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), official sources familiar with the plan have revealed.
Foreign ministers of China and the interim Afghan government were in Islamabad recently for a trilateral meeting to discuss the current situation in Afghanistan. Among the issues on the agenda included terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan. While Pakistan is concerned over the presence of the TTP and its affiliates, China wants the Afghan Taliban to neutralise the threat posed by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM).
The Afghan Taliban government is thought to be working on a plan to address the Chinese concerns as it has relocated ETIM militants believed to be in the hundreds from the border. But the issue of TTP still looms large. After the Taliban takeover, there were expectations in Pakistan that the issue of the TTP would be dealt with once and for all.
When Pakistan sought action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban instead came with a proposal to broker a deal with the militant outfit. Islamabad reluctantly accepted the proposal and initially talks made progress, with the TTP announcing a ceasefire in return for Pakistan freeing certain militants.
As part of the confidence-building measures Pakistan allowed hundreds of TTP fighters to resettle in the country. However, the process soon went into trouble as returning fighters started targeting the security forces.
The surge in the TTP terrorist attacks compelled Pakistan’s civil and military leadership to abandon the peace process. The current civil and military leadership publicly acknowledged that the policy to seek peace with the TTP was wrong. The government decided that it would no longer seek peace talks with the TTP.

During the visit of interim Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, Pakistan once again raised the issue. However, official sources said that the Afghan foreign minister was adamant that Pakistan should talk to the TTP. He expressed his desire at the keynote speech he delivered at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad.
But the sources said Pakistan did not agree. Pakistan wanted the interim Afghan government to find ways to deal with the TTP. The TTP issue has threatened to undermine bilateral ties between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban.
The sources said in order to break the stalemate, China was pursuing both sides to agree on a “workable solution”. The Afghan Taliban earlier proposed the relocation of TTP fighters from Pakistani bordering areas but asked Pakistan to bear the cost. It is believed that a similar plan was offered to China by the Afghan Taliban to address the issue of ETIM.
The sources said China was keen that both sides do not lose sight of the bigger picture while addressing the issue of TTP. Essentially, sources said, China doesn’t want the TTP issue to undermine bilateral ties between the two countries, something that would be detrimental to regional connectivity.
Last week at a press conference Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang hoped "Pakistan and Afghanistan will bear in mind the larger picture and try to work out the issues between them through dialogue and consultation."
His statement, according to officials, suggests that Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban must not take the issue of TTP to a point of no return.
The sources said Pakistan was using the good offices of China to press upon the Afghan Taliban on the TTP issue. China has leverage over the Afghan Taliban, according to sources. Pakistan is trying that China use that financial and economic leverage over the Afghan Taliban to address the issue of terrorist sanctuaries.
 
A district and sessions court in Islamabad declared as inadmissible a petition that contented that former premier Imran Khan and former first lady Bushra Bibi cohabited despite the fact that their first nikah had taken place without completion of the latter’s mandatory iddat period.
The petitioner, a Muhammad Haneef, claimed that Bushra Bibi was divorced by her former husband in November 2017 and married Imran Khan on January 1, 2018 despite the fact that her iddat period had not completed “which is against the Sharia and the Muslim norms.”
The complainant submitted in the court the statements of Mufti Muhammad Saeed who conducted the marriage between Imran and Bushra and Awn Chaundhry—Imran’s close firend—who was one of the witnesses.
The court noted that the alleged nikah was solemnized in Lahore.  “Therefore, the offense, if any, was committed, [took place] within the jurisdiction of [the] learned court of competent jurisdiction [in] Lahore, which could have the cognizance thereof.”
The session court judge, Nasrumminallah, noted that the complainant if aggrieved of any act of the respondents should approach the court of competent jurisdiction in Lahore.
Describing the reasons for filing the petition in Islamabad, the petitioner said Imran and Bushra moved to the federal capital soon after their nikah and went into “valid retirement” at Imran’s Bani Gala residence. Therefore, he said, a court in Islamabad should hear the case.
When a husband and wife are alone together under circumstances that present no legal, moral or physical impediment to marital intercourse, they are said to be in “valid retirement” which is a translation of “khilwat-us-sahiha”, a term in Sharia law
The court, however, said it lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of the matter as the nikah was solemnized in the territorial jurisdiction of a competent court in Lahore. “Hence the instant petition is not preceed-able within the territorial jurisdiction of this court,” it said.
 
As the government weighs the option of imposing emergency, in the words of federal ministers, to arrest the deteriorating situation in the country, legal experts question the actual motive behind the consideration of the extreme measure, stating that even if the approval of the president issue was dealt with, the circumstances requiring to impose emergency were ‘currently’ not there.
As the country gradually returns to normalcy after PTI Chairman Imran Khan was granted bail by the IHC, the talk of emergency re-emerges, with claims that the federal government had even discussed the option in Friday’s cabinet meeting.
Rebutting media reports in this regard, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb in a statement said that the government has not taken any such decision. The statement, however, did not deny that the issue came up for discussion during the cabinet meeting. Two federal ministers have already indicated that the government was weighing the option of emergency.
Legal experts on the other hand questioned the actual motive behind the move, with some seeing it as a means to prolong the government tenure that is completing its five-year constitutional term in August. Former attorney general of Pakistan and former special assistant to Prime Minister of the incumbent government, Irfan Qadir while talking to The Express Tribune, said there was no substance to the debate. “Government ministers say such things for media consumption”.
He said the government requires the approval of the president or a provincial assembly’s resolution, and both the options were not available to it. He said that the president can be advised by the prime minister to impose a state of emergency under Article 232. However, when asked can the president not use his own discretionary powers under Article 48(2) and refuse to accept the prime minister’s advise, Irfan said that indeed, he could. He said that this in any way remain a very difficult option for the government.
Justice (retd) Wajehuddin Ahmad, while talking to The Express Tribune, said that the circumstances required to impose the emergency were not there, to begin with. He, lamenting the decision of calling paramilitary forces to control the law and order situation, said that no such circumstances had arisen requiring the need for paramilitary forces to be called out. “Police could have easily managed the situation.”
“The only reason for considering the imposition of emergency seems to be, to extend their (government) tenure,” he stated. He said in a situation, where two assemblies were not available, ninety days limit for conducting elections had exhausted, and only around two months are left to the expiry of the tenure of the National Assembly and the remaining provincial assemblies, the only beneficiary of this step would be the central government.
He said that considering the option was one thing, but imposing it would be tall order as it requires satisfaction of the president, which means that he can even refuse to act on the cabinet’s advice. He said that during emergency, the government had powers to suspend fundamental rights. He said that usually courts do not intervene in the event of imposition of emergencies, but in exceptional circumstances, courts can review any decision of the cabinet.
Former Justice and senior jurist Nasira Javeed said that the government and the party in power were saying and doing what they desire, disregarding the law and the Constitution at every step of the way.
She said that a coalition partner was planning to hold a dharna outside the Supreme Court. She said that the issue of imposition of the emergency might require the president’s approval, but the way it had used strong arm tactics with every institution, the government might even force the president to ascent to it.
Senior lawyer Hamid Khan, while talking to The Express Tribune, said that the government was in fact trying to create the necessary circumstances to impose emergency. He said that by delaying elections, the government has created the circumstances that are not covered under the Constitution.
He said that how they could impose emergency in Punjab and K-P where assemblies were not available. “Whose power will the government assume, if emergency is imposed?”
“The Punjab and K-P caretaker governments do not enjoy complete powers,” he said and added that by violating one article of the Constitution of not holding elections within 90 days, the government was pushing the entire country towards anarchy, as the Constitution was completely silent on problems that we today find the country in.
Article 232 of the Constitution, “Proclamation of emergency on account of war, internal disturbance, etc.,” reads “ (1) If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists in which the security of Pakistan, or any part thereof, is threatened by war or external aggression, or by internal disturbance beyond the power of a Provincial Government to control, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency.
Provided that for imposition of emergency due to internal disturbances beyond the powers of a Provincial Government to control, a resolution from the Provincial Assembly of that Province shall be required: Provided further that if the President acts on his own, the Proclamation of Emergency shall be placed before both Houses of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) for approval by each House within ten days.
The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Saturday condemned PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s statement against the army chief, calling him a "terrorist disguised as a politician".
According to a statement from the PDM, the former prime minister was a “terrorist” in the guise of a politician and was attacking the chief of the army staff (COAS) for standing by the Constitution and for their “refusal to interfere in politics”.
“The person who launched a dirty campaign against the martyrs of Lasbela, is now running a campaign against the army and COAS,” the statement maintained.
It claimed that the “American Jewish lobby” was concerned about him, thus the PDM could understand Imran’s qualms against an army chief who was a Hafiz of the Holy Quran (memorized the scripture), and was an “honest and professional” COAS.
The statement continued that the “problem” was that the “facility to offer extensions” [to those in power] behind closed doors and “in the president’s house” was no longer available to the PTI chief. It added that Imran could be “a degenerate” as much as he wanted, but the “selection facility” was closed.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court (IHC) requesting it to direct authorities to provide him a fresh report containing details of all the criminal cases registered against him on or after May 9, the day when he was arrested from Islamabad.
The PTI chairman has also requested the court to order authorities not to arrest him in any case without prior permission of the court. He has nominated Punjab inspector general police (IGP) and the State through Punjab advocate general as respondents in the plea.
In the petition moved through Imran’s counsel Barrister Salman Safdar, the former premier has contended that more than 100 politically motivated and unlawful first information reports (FIRs) have been lodged against him alone.
“All [this] amounts to grave violation of the petitioner’s rights under Articles 4, 9, 10-A and others and consequently through the instant petition, the petitioner seeks the protection of this court from the most audacious assault on the fundamental rights launched by an executive of this country…
“[This assault is launched] in furtherance of the most constitutionally abhorrent objective: to prevent or delay elections required by the Constitution in order to ensure that the largest political party in Pakistan may be prevented from participating or winning such elections,” it said.

He said extraordinary nature of the attack on fundamental rights of the party workers and leaders—their rights to life and liberty, fair trial, dignity and privacy of home, movement, assembly, association, speech and equal treatment guaranteed under different articles of the Constitution means that the intervention of this court is required in order to protect and enforce the said rights and the rule of law.
“The petitioner’s [Imran Khan’s] political struggle has always been to establish democracy and equity of law in the country and to eliminate the menace of corruption,” he noted.
The PTI chief contended that he, his party’s top leadership and workers had been subject to victimization at hand of the ruling parties who registered false cases against them
He said he had been granted bails in all cases, while he had approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for a pre-arrest bail in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) investigation when NAB authorities “attacked” the biometric office at the IHC and illegally and unlawfully arrested the petitioner.
“Around hundred security personnel attacked the biometric room vandalizing and ransacking the room in the court premises in order to execute a warrant of arrest reportedly issued by the NAB authorities.”
He requested the court to order authorities to submit a fresh report containing details of all the criminal cases registered against him on or after May 9, the day when he was arrested from Islamabad.
 “The petitioner has learnt that a number of criminal cases have been registered against the petitioner and there is a strong apprehension that [he] may again unjustifiably be arrested in mentioned undisclosed new criminal cases registered on or after May 9, 2023,” he added.
Suspending a detention notification, the Lahore High Court (LHC) has ordered release of eighteen women –supporters, workers and politicians of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), including former provincial minister Dr Yasmin Rashid
These women were detained on charges of vandalism, setting ablaze public properties and disturbing law and order after the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on May 9 from Islamabad High Court premises.
LHC’s Justice Safdar Saleem Shahid issued an order for release of these women while hearing a slew of petitions challenging their detention under Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960.
The judge also sought a report from the concerned authorities by May 15 on the disappearance of former PTI provincial minister Ali Afzal Sahi after police officials told the court that Sahi was not in their custody.
During proceedings, her counsel said Dr Yasmin Rashid is a senior citizen and a cancer patient. He said while false cases were registered against many PTI workers and leaders, a number of them were also detained under the Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance. 1960.
“The government imposed Section 144 to restrain political workers from exercising their democratic right,” he said. Justice Shahid asked the state law officer if Section 144 could be imposed after the announcement of the election date.
When asked for reasons for her detention, the law officer said Dr Rashid is the PTI’s central Punjab president and participates in every activity of the party. “If she had avoided participating in the political activities, the authorities would not have issued her detention order.”
He said there was evidence of Dr Rashid involvement in an attack on the residence of Lahore Corps Commander. Justice Shahid remarked that this incident occurred on May 9 but the detention notification was issued on May 12.
“You people should have registered an FIR rather than detaining the people,” he said.
The law officer argued the unpleasant incidents could not be stopped even if an FIR was registered. “Dr Yasmin Rashid was leading a crowd of thousands of people,” he said.
After hearing detailed arguments, the judge first reserved the decision. He later suspended the detention notification with direction to release Dr Rashid with immediate effect.
During the proceedings, counsels for the petitioners argued that the clients are respectable women—some of them are members of bar association while the rest are housewives.
They contended that the women are neither active members of any political party nor are involved in any anti-state activities;  they even have no connection with any political party nor their activities are prejudicial to the police safety and maintenance of public order.

Justice Shahid also sought a report by May 15 on a plea seeking recovery of the former provincial minister Ali Afzal Sahi. During the proceedings, the additional inspector general police told the court that neither the police arrested Sahi nor he was in their custody right now.
The petitioner’s counsel told the court that Ali Afzal Sahi was arrested from the district bar office but now authorities are hiding his arrest. Police officials told the court that they had formed a team to investigate the matter.

“Our interest is a safe, secure and prosperous Pakistan. That is in the interest of the US-Pakistan relations, and we call for the respect of democratic principles and the rule of law around the world,” he said.
The United States, he said, does not have a favourite candidate or a favourite political party; not just in Pakistan but anywhere around the world.
“On some of these areas such as press freedom, human rights and things of that nature, we have consistently raised these issues with our counterparts – not just in Pakistan – but also in other countries where we have a perspective to offer on that,” Patel said in response to a question.
The spokesperson said the US was looking to continue strengthening economic ties between the two countries with collaboration in areas of security, renewable energy, climate crisis and increasing agricultural trade.
“That’s what we mean by a strong, prosperous, and democratic Pakistan that is critical to US interests,” the spokesperson added.
The vandalism and arson during protests by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers across the country and the government's shutdown of the internet for three days have taken a toll on the national exchequer as it suffered a loss of more than Rs3.5 billion.
As business activities have been affected, the Federal Board of Revenue also lost about Rs2 billion in terms of revenue, but the Pakistan Software Export Association (PSEA) said that a day's business of the information technology sector is $12 million. Therefore in three days, the PSEA said, the IT sector suffered a loss of Rs10 billion.
According to details, a loss of Rs1.14 billion has been incurred due to the vandalism and burning of government property during the protest of PTI workers, while the initial estimate of the loss to the telecom sector is around Rs2 billion.
About Rs600 million tax revenue was lost due to the shutdown of telephone, internet, and social media. Due to the protests, thousands of daily wage labourers lost their jobs across the country, while the business of transporters was also affected due to the shutdown of transport.
All eyes will be on the Supreme Court on May 15 (Monday), as it will take up the Election Commission of Pakistan’s plea requesting the top court to revisit its order of holding Punjab Assembly elections on May 14.
A three-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar will hear the ECP’s plea.
On April 4, the same bench had quashed the ECP’s decision to extend the poll date from April 10 to Oct 8 and fixed May 14 as the new date for it.
The bench had also directed the government to release Rs21 billion funds for holding the elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
However, the ECP had apprised the court that the coalition government was reluctant to release the funds.
It contended that holding separate elections in Punjab and K-P would incur more expenses as compared to holding them on the same day.
On May 3, the ECP filed a plea asking the apex court to review its April 4 order.
Earlier during the month, the government and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf developed a consensus on conducting elections across the country on one day but failed to agree on a date for holding them.
The ECP in its review plea said that changing the election schedule was its domain under Section 58 of the Elections Act 2017.
“All provisions of the Constitution are required to be read together in harmony to make the provisions effective, workable and meaningful,” the plea stated.

It explained that Punjab and K-P had 173 and 55 National Assembly seats, respectively, out of a total of 326 seats, which made the seats of both the assemblies around 72% of the NA’s total strength.
The plea stated that the general elections to the NA were due in the near future, as it was completing its term in Aug 2023, adding that the ECP required the government machinery which was non-partisan to conduct them fairly and in accordance with the law.
It urged the court to consider ground realities in true perspective because if the polls were held while permanent govenrments were in place in both the provinces, the sanctity, objectivity and fairness of the elections to 72% of the general deats of the NA would be compromised.
The petition emphasised that the courts interpreted the law but they did not rewrite it. As per the interpretation of the provision of Section 58, change of the election schedule or giving a fresh schedule, of which poll date was an essential component or stage, was the domain of the ECP.
“Under no provision of the Constitution or the law, the Supreme Court could have taken the exercise upon itself to appoint the poll date through the April 4 order. The Constitution is an organic document, it blossoms and evolves with time.”
It added that the appointing of a date or changing it was an executive exercise, and certainly not a judicial one.
