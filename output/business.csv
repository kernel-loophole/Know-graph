1,Extortionists whip up fear among businessmen,Three traders killed in a month after refusing to pay extortion money,"The resurgence of extortion in the city has heightened concerns among businessmen and industrialists. December witnessed 11 reported cases, a notable decrease from the 60 cases recorded throughout the just ended year. 
Despite Karachi police’s claims to bolster law and order, street crime persists, leaving the business community uneasy. A network, allegedly from Iran and Afghanistan, is implicated in the deaths of three businessmen within a month due to non-payment of extortion demand. Apparently, Sindh police’s efforts to dismantle this network appear insufficient.
The recent incidents include the broad daylight killing of Shahzad Jafarani, a steel trader, in South district at city’s busiest market. A gang war operative involved in the murder was reportedly killed in a police encounter. In the New Karachi Industrial Area, Osama Moon, a businessman’s son, was attacked by suspects who had demanded extortion money.

A suspect who had demanded Rs20 million worth of extortion money from a dyeing factory owner was apprehended within the Azizabad police station’s jurisdiction.

The Citizen Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) reported 11 extortion cases in December, acknowledging that many cases go unreported due to businessmen’s fear of dire consequences from criminals.
Despite the establishment of a Specialized Investigation Unit (SIU) by the CIA to probe extortion cases, challenges persist in identifying suspects distributing extortion slips. As a result, industrialists are advised to remain vigilant regarding routes, timings, and vehicle changes during their journeys.

The final phase of training for female drivers is underway at Mehran Depot and is set to conclude on January 15.
Despite Pakistan facing challenges in terms of gender equality, courageous women in Karachi are actively working to narrow this gap by venturing into non-traditional fields. The women-only pink buses, which previously employed women conductors, will now also feature women drivers.
According to details, the Sindh Mass Transit Authority, a division of the Sindh government, has initiated training for 18 women on diesel hybrid, electric hybrid, and fully electric buses. Training encompasses a range of skills and equipment, such as driving, engine, battery, communication, and safety protocols.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Kiran Iftikhar, confidently taking the driving seat of a hybrid bus, said that with strong ambitions, nothing is insurmountable. She emphasised that women have the capability to drive buses and will prove it through their actions. Kiran urged other women to step out of their homes, learn, and contribute to the workforce.

Zakia also encouraged transgenders stepping forward, emphasising equality among all citizens.

8,SHC allows PTI leaders to contest polls,"Rejects pleas against candidature of Khurram Sher Zaman, Awab Alvi, Muzamil Aslam and Alamgir Khan","The Sindh High Court rejected the petitions against the acceptance of nomination papers of PTI's Khurram Sher Zaman, Awab Alvi and Muzamil Aslam from constituency NA-241 and upheld their candidature.
A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Sindh High Court Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi heard the petitions against the Election Tribunal's decision about PTI candidates.
The lawyer supporting the rejection plea said that Khurram Sher Zaman had not mentioned his wife's assets in the documents. The court inquired whether these assets belong to Khurram Sher Zaman or his wife. 
The lawyer argued that it is the matter of concealment of assets. According to the election law, a candidate is also obliged to disclose the assets of his wife. Khurram Sher Zaman's wife Bushra Sher Zaman's sales tax account has been suspended. Account suspension is also due to the fraud.
The Chief Justice while giving remarks said that such objections are not made on this occasion. The court told the lawyer, you can file an application even after the election. ""At this point we have to see that there is no misrepresentation in the basic details of the proposer, endorser or candidate. You are considering suspension of sales tax account as a criminal penalty.""
Haider Waheed Advocate stated that the business of Khurram Sher Zaman's wife was closed in 2012. The lawyer objected to the position that Khurram Sher Zaman has not been notified yet. Lawyers cannot represent him. If more time is needed to collect the material, it can be provided.
About Muzamil Aslam the lawyer said that he did not disclose the vehicles among his assets.

Muzamil's lawyer stated that whenever he brings the vehicle on the road, he will get it registered and pay the tax. There is no question of loss to the public exchequer.
The lawyer, on the objection against the approval of the papers of Awab Alvi, the third candidate from NA-241, the son of President Alvi, took the stand that Awab Alvi was allowed to participate in the election illegally.
The Chief Justice remarked that this application is also from the same constituency. The lawyer stated that petitions have been filed against all PTI candidates.
The lawyer submitted that the objection is raised by Muhammad Dost, a Pakistan dost citizen. He does not want corrupt elements to become parliamentarians.
The Chief Justice smilingly directed the lawyer of the objector to introduce us to that Pakistan dost man sometime. The court rejected the application of objections against the three PTI candidates and allowed them to participate in the election.
Meanwhile, the same bench of the Sindh High Court accepted the petition of PTI leader Alamgir Khan, a candidate from NA-236, against the decision of the Appellate Tribunal.
The court accepted the petition of Alamgir Khan and annulled the decision of the Election Tribunal and allowed the PTI leader Alamgir Khan to participate in the election from constituency NA-236. Alamgir Khan's nomination papers were rejected by the returning officer.
Besides, the Sindh High Court accepted the petition of PTI candidate Syed Amjad Hussain Shah against the decision of the Election Tribunal in constituency PS-75 Thatta. 
The petitioner's counsel took the stand that Amjad Shah has sold the vehicle, the dues are less than 10,000 and he has been acquitted.
The court allowed the candidate to contest the election. Syed Amjad Shah's papers were rejected by the RO and then by the Appellate Tribunal.
