1,DJ College admits students with low grades contrary to policy,Online data shows students with higher percentage denied admission,"The provincial Directorate of College Education ignored the merit-based central admission policy (CAP) of Sindh E-Centralised College Admission Programme (SECCAP) in Karachi's Deyaram Jethamal (DJ) Sindh Government Science College.
SECAP is an online transparent admission process based on merit where admission in XI in government colleges is granted on merit as per the past closing percentage of the institution. 
In 2021, admissions to DJ Sindh Government Science College closed at 82.6% for pre-engineering group. However, students with C, D and E grades were granted admission in DJ Sindh Government Science College in the newly opened Computer Science faculty, while those having A and B grade were denied entrance to the most sought after science college of the city, according to the information available on SECCAP online dashboard.
According to officials of the Directorate of College Education, XI placement list for DJ Science College was sent by the central admission committee, in which 89 students got admission in faculty of pre-engineering, 245 in pre-medical and 106 in the newly established computer science faculty. According to this information, 440 students were admitted this year.
In these computer science admissions, 12 students of A+ grade, 11 students of A grade, 19 students of B grade, 34 students of C grade and 26 students of D grade were admitted. However as per the merit policy, students of A and B grades should have gotten admission instead of C and D grade.
The matter did not stop there. Documents show that four students of grade E were also given admission in computer science, while according to the rules students of grade E are not admitted to science faculty.
When The Express Tribune contacted Assistant Professor Rashid Khoso, who runs the central admission policy, he said that sometimes students tamper the mark sheet to get admission. However, when he was asked how could students tamper numbers when the placement lists in colleges were issued on the data obtained from the Board of Secondary Education Karachi? He said the college concerned can cancel the admission if there is any discrepancy in the placement list.
Besides, to confirm Rashid Khoso's claim and to know the position of the college administration, The Express Tribune contacted DJ Science College Principal Professor Meher Mangi. However, he avoided contact and did not respond to the message.
It should be remembered that 22 years ago, in the year 2000, the central admission policy (CAP) was made by the government of Sindh to reject the pressure and establish merit in government colleges of Karachi. 
The authority of admissions was transferred from the principals to the central admission committee because principals of big and reputed colleges generally complained of pressure from student organisations, political parties and ministers for admissions against merit.
In the colleges where admissions were closed at A1 grade, they had to make C and D grade admissions under pressure.

3,"‘PPP, MQM-P fixing LG polls’",Tessori has been acting more as a representative of the MQM-P than the people of Sindh,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Parliamentary Leader in the Sindh Assembly Khurrum Sher Zaman on Wednesday asked the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) take notice of the match-fixing occurring between the PPP and MQM-P for the local bodies' elections in Karachi and Hyderabad.
He also called for appointing a neutral person as Karachi administrator. In a statement, Zaman strongly criticised the partisanship of Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori though the role of the governor should be apolitical
Zaman pointed out that ever since Kamran Tessori was appointed the Governor of Sindh on October 9, 2022, he has been acting more as a representative of the MQM-P than the people of Sindh.  In other words, Governor Sindh is like a mafia Godfather, the head of the mob.

Meanwhile, the deputy commissioners of nine districts of Hyderabad division will submit their reply regarding arrangements for the LG polls on Thursday.
According to sources, the ECP Sindh had asked the deputy commissioners of the districts of Karachi and Hyderabad to answer nine questions regarding arrangements for the LG elections which have been postponed thrice. Some of these questions are as follow:
1. Whether the Returning Officers and Assistant Returning Officers are performing their duties?
2. Is polling staff available and properly trained to conduct the LG elections?
3. Are sensitive and non-sensitive materials secure with polling bags?
4. Have arrangements been made to install CCTV cameras at all ""Highly Sensitive"" polling stations?
5. Identification of suitable dispatch centers and availability of potable water, uninterrupted power supply, including standby generator, internet facility, seating arrangement, transportation for bringing election materials and polling staff, washrooms and parking facility are available?
6. Has furniture been provided at the polling stations and has the transportation plan been updated?
The seven deputy commissioners of Karachi division submitted their answers to these questions to the ECP Sindh on Wednesday. Deputy Commissioners or District Returning Officers (DROs) of some districts said that some Returning Officers and Assistant Returning Officers have been transferred, but all other arrangements are complete. The DROs said that work on most of the administrative matters related to the LG polls in Karachi is complete.
However, the Deputy Commissioners of the nine districts of Hyderabad Division will submit their answers to these questions on Thursday.
The Sindh government has already excused from providing security for the LG elections in Karachi. Further, it has requested the ECP to postpone the municipal elections for three months. The exercise to elect representatives at the grassroots level has been postponed by the ECP three times on the requests of the Sindh government. Now, the ECP is likely to announce in the next few days when it could hold the LG elections.

5,Gas crisis may risk textile exports,The textile industry has been hit the hardest by the gas crisis as they have to keep their boilers burning,"As the natural gas rationing hit domestic and industrial consumers alike with the onset of winter, industrialists fear that textile exports to the United States and the European Union (EU) could face restrictions due to use of wood and coal to power their units.
Domestic consumers in Karachi are already struggling to find alternate fuels to keep their kitchen stoves burning. Now industrial units have also joined them as they have started using wood and coal as fuel. Industrialists say that the gas crisis is pushing them two centuries back.
The textile industry has been hit the hardest by the gas crisis as they have to keep their boilers burning. But due to non-availability of gas, they are forced to burn wood or coal, which adds to environmental pollution. This could put textile exports to the US and the EU in risk because these Western importers are very particular about the industry's role in climate change.
Pakistan Apparel Forum Chairman Javed Balwani said that around 150 industrial units in Karachi are currently using wood and 50 to 70 units are using coal as fuel. ""The gas supply company has asked the industries to manage our production capacity to 50%. This means now we have to reduce our exports by 50%,"" he told The Express Tribune.
While the export industry is already facing problems like dollar shortage and non-opening of import letters of credits for raw material, now they have also been deprived of natural gas, he said.
The production cost of the export industry has increased three to five times due to the use of wood, coal, and furnaces, Balwani said. ""Pakistani exporters are in a very bad situation and no one is listening to the exporters of Karachi who contribute 54% of the country's total exports,"" he added.
