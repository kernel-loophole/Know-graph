0,Centre unhappy with Dogar heading Imran attack JIT,Federal govt expresses lack of confidence in latest formed team,"The federal government on Wednesday raised its objections over the joint investigation team (JIT) formed by Punjab to probe into the gun attack on PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan’s “Haqeeqi Azadi March” on November 3 in the province’s Wazirabad area.
It expressed its lack of confidence in the JIT headed by Lahore police chief Ghulam Mahmood Dogar.
The interior ministry has written a letter to the Punjab government, telling it to form an “actual” JIT with the inclusion of the representatives of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB).
It has also told the Punjab government to include police officials, who were held in high esteem for their performances, in the team.
The ministry complained to the Punjab government that it had formed a five-member JIT with no inclusion of any intelligence official.
It added that it had appointed a controversial figure like Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dogar, whose suspension had been temporarily put off by the Federal Service Tribunal, as the convener of the JIT.
The letter further read that the people did not have confidence in Dogar, and the Punjab government lacked the capacity to conduct a transparent inquiry into the attack.
A day earlier, the Punjab home department notified Dogar as the head of the JIT formed to investigate the Wazirabad attack in which the PTI chief suffered gun shot wounds to his leg.
According to party leader Asad Umar, doctors had told him that even though Imran was in a stable condition, there were two or three pellets still lodged in his body, especially the bone.
One person had died in the attack, while several members of the PTI chairman’s close circle, including Senator Faisal Javed, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail, Ahmad Chattha and Imran Yousaf, were injured.
Earlier this month, a relative of the PTI chairman had moved an application to register an FIR against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Major General Faisal Naseer, the three suspects named by Imran behind the botched assassination attempt on his life.
However, the FIR was registered on the complaint of a sub-inspector police and the three top officials cited by the PTI chief have not been nominated in the case.
Dogar has remained the bone of contention between the PML-N-led federal and PTI-led provincial governments in recent weeks.
The Centre and Punjab government have locked horns after the Establishment Division issued a transfer and then a suspension order of the Lahore CCPO.
However, the Punjab government had asked him not to leave the charge and continue the work as the Lahore police chief.
Later, the FST had put off the transfer and suspension order of Dogar.
It directed the Establishment Division to decide the Lahore police chief’s petition against his transfer order first.
On the same day, the Lahore High Court issued notices to the concerned quarters on seeking a reply in a plea challenging Dogar’s continuity of tenure despite his suspension.
According to the petitioner Safdar Abbas Khan, the Lahore CCPO had continued to hold office despite having been suspended by the federal government.
Dogar on Tuesday paid a visit to the PTI chief’s residence in Zaman Park. Hours later, a notification appointing him the convenor of the JIT was issued.
In the first JIT, DIG Establishment-II Tariq Rustam Chohan was appointed the convenor of the JIT and the members included RPO DG Khan Syed Khurram Ali, AIG Monitoring Punjab Ihsan Ullah Chohan, DPO Vehari Zafar Buzdar and RO CTD Lahore Naseeb Ulllah Khan.
In the JIT notified on November 11, RPO DG Khan Syed Khurram Ali was appointed the convenor. Another change was that of the replacement of DPO Vehari Zafar Buzdar with SP Potohar Division Malik Tariq Mehboob. The other members remained unchanged. The JIT convenor could co-opt for the sixth member of his choice.
Dogar, the newly appointed convenor, can also do the same for the appointment of the sixth member.
In the latest JIT, DIG Rustam Chohan has been dropped.
It is worth mentioning that the JIT has yet to hold its first meeting before starting the Investigation even though two weeks since the attack occurred have passed.

1,President has yet not given up on mediation to end political impasse,"Alvi says free, fair and transparent election only way out of political, economic morass","Despite escalating political brinkmanship, President Arif Alvi has yet not given up on his efforts to mediate a way out of the political imbroglio spawned by the toppling of PTI government which has toxified the social environment, polarized the nation, and stymied the economy. He believes an early election is the only way to wriggle out of the political and economic morass.
President Alvi spoke his heart out on a wide array of issues at an interaction with senior editors at the Governor House in Karachi on Wednesday. “I have been trying to bring all stakeholders to the negotiating table to evolve consensus on major issues to normalize the political situation,” he said. “Economic stability hinges on political stability.”
The PTI and the governing coalition have let loose their hawks for political duelling, which is only adding to bitterness in their rhetoric. But President Alvi believes both sides have saner, wiser and pragmatic politicians who can deescalate the situation. Politicians can resolve all issues on the negotiating table, if they show flexibility for the sake of democracy.
Asked about his legacy, President Alvi said he has tried to strengthen the federation though “I am a small man in big office”. He said that only history would determine his performance as a president. The ultimate aim and objective of leaders and visionaries is development of their country and progress of their people.
Currently, the media is fixated on who army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa would pass the baton to as he doffs the uniform in November following his extended term. And this is providing grist to the rumour mill. Rumour has it that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was in London to consult his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif, on the possible successor of Gen Qamar.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif was quick to quell these rumours.Nonetheless Imran Khan and his party colleagues said that Shehbaz has breached the Official Secrets Act by consulting a “convicted fugitive” on the important appointment. But interestingly, President Alvi, who also belongs to the PTI, sees no harm in consultation among “relevant stakeholders” on the army chief’s appointment which, he says, should be made as per relevant provision of the Constitution and relevant laws.
One questioner also raked up the killing of TV journalist Arshad Sharif in Kenya last month. It was reported in the media that Sharif had written a letter to President Alvi seeking help in view of threats to his life in Pakistan. The president confirmed that he had received a letter from Sharif and that within the confines of the Constitution, he wrote a letter to the prime minister, the executive head of the government, for necessary action as per law.
The current political polarization appears to have disillusioned the youth amid a vicious narrative being peddled on social media. But President Alvi doesn’t think such polarization would last long. “With the continuity of the democratic process things would eventually fall into place,” he said.
The President further said that social media has enhanced and amplified people’s reach and provided a means to communicate with millions of people without incurring substantial costs. Social media platforms such as Twitter, WhatsApp, TikTok and Facebook have created their own separate niche and space, he said.
“We should endeavour to understand its full dynamics, influence, efficacy and effect and embrace its positive aspects and learn to avoid and limit its negative fallouts like fake news, disinformation and hearsay,” he added.
“We should further strengthen our resilience while reacting to everything that is injected in the media and only authentic, verifiable, and evidence-based things may be taken into proper consideration so as to avoid confrontation and remain focused on the political and economic well-being of the country.”
President Alvi regretted that the media did not play its role in supporting electoral reforms, especially the introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs) which, according to him, have been in use in neighbouring India since long.
Reforms may not be possible in the upcoming elections, but he called upon the media to guide the politicians on electoral reforms that could ensure free, fair and transparent elections and put an end to perennial allegations of rigging once and for all.
President Alvi said that as compared to its neighbours, Pakistan successfully emerged out of the Covid-19 pandemic and was able to save lives and livelihoods of the people through education and communication.
He added that the country also faced a shortage of essential commodities and high inflation due to the Russia-Ukraine war and recently faced catastrophic floods. “We need to resolve our issues and waste no time to put the country on the speedy path of progress and prosperity,” he said.
In reply to another question, the president said that he had proposed a high-level advisory body to provide leadership in Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing so that a definite direction was provided to the relevant institutions and departments for moving forward which, he said, took a backstage due to political developments. He said that in his opinion such developmental projects and initiatives should continue to remain in limelight.
He said that the right decisions made at the right time, quality decision-making, intellect and knowledge, trained and capable human resources and persistent efforts in the right directions, just and fair application of laws in all situations and on all persons in its true spirit, intent and purpose would help in accelerated development and prosperity of the country.
Replying to another question, he said that we should take immediate and concrete steps to realize the full potential of Gwadar port and other related projects, speed up our work processes and systems to attract and retain foreign investors in large numbers and fully exploit opportunities available to Pakistan in the trade and business sectors for making fast track progress and development.

2,$30b flood assessment grossly flawed,Foreign-funded report ignores flood-hit population,"In a startling revelation, a top official has admitted that the government did not have district-wise data of the population affected by the recent devastating floods in the country, undermining the authenticity of the Post-Disaster Need Assessment report that put the losses at over $30 billion.
The shocking disclosure of ignoring the human cost in terms of man and material was made by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Director (Operations) Brig Muhammad Umar, while responding to a query during the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance held on Wednesday.
As the winter sets in, the absence of the data has left hundreds of thousands people without basic needs such as blankets and tents, leaving them at the mercy of fast approaching harsh weather, revealed the committee proceedings.
The committee meeting was convened to discuss two pressing issues — whether any punitive action was taken against the commercial banks that manipulated the exchange rate, and most important of all the relief and rehabilitation effort in the flood-affected areas.
“I do not have the data of the affected people,” commented the NDMA’s director (operations) when MNA Dr Nafisa Shah inquired whether he knew how many people were affected in Sindh’s Khairpur district.
Dr Shah raised the question when the director briefed that so far, the authority had distributed 9,000 blankets and about 9,380 tents in district Khairpur — the constituency of Dr Shah.
According to the assessment of Dr Shah, between 100,000 to 150,000 people have been affected by the floods in the Khairpur district. She said that since there was no town- and district-level data available with the NDMA so far, thousands of people in her constituency had been left at the mercy of harsh weather and in search of warm shelter and clothes to avoid being exposed to cold.
“There is no denying the fact that the relief goods are coming but there is no union council-level data available,” she added. The MNA said that house listing exercise had started but complained the exercise was carrying out at a slow pace.
The revelations also put a question mark on the government’s claims of providing relief to the people and the utility of the PDNA report that has been prepared by the World Bank with the collaboration of the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the European Union.
The report has estimated the cost of damages and losses at $30.2 billion and worked out the reconstruction cost at $16.3 billion. But it does not provide the details of the 33 million flood-affected people that the government and the PDNA reports have claimed.
“One-third of the country has been under water, and 33 million people have been affected. Nearly 8 million people are reportedly displaced,” according to the PDNA. The report further stated that the floods had taken the lives of more than 1,700 people, one-third of which were children.

But Dr Shah said that about 5,000 to 6,000 children died only in her constituency, including those who died due to water-borne diseases. There are families who got food packets more than once but there are also families that have not received any food parcel due to absence of the data, Dr Shah added.
Pakistan has been appealing to the world for aid to reach out to the affected people without having credible data of the affected individuals. In October Pakistan revised its emergency aid appeal to the United Nations members for $816 million to cover the most urgent needs of 9.5 million people. However, as of October 21, only 13.7% of the requested amount has been funded, according to the PDNA report.
Headed by the PML-N’s Qaiser Ahmad Sheikh, the standing committee also took the issue of a delay in penalising the commercial banks for currency manipulation.
The proceedings showed that the legislators belonging to the ruling alliance ran out of patience for the economic team’s failure to bring the rupee-dollar parity below Rs200 and also imposed fines.
“[Finance Minister] Ishaq Dar should appear before the standing committee and tell us why he is not able to bring the dollar down below Rs200”, demanded the PML-N’s senior legislator, Chaudhry Barjees Tahir.
Tahir said that poor are penalised for committing small crimes but the rich banks have been spared despite playing with the destiny of the nation. “Today’s big story is that no action has been taken against the banks”.
SBP Deputy Governor Dr Inayat Hussain said that the hearing process of the banks was “almost complete” and the central bank was currently conducting “internal validation”. He said that the penalties against the banks would be imposed by November 30 – a similar statement given by the SBP governor earlier this week.
Hussain said that due to global and domestic problems, the capital inflows were drying up and the financial inflows were falling below the needs, resulting in constant pressure on the value of the rupee. The deputy governor hoped that the situation would improve in the next couple of months.
“First, we tried Miftah Ismail and then Ishaq Dar, now who is next in line”, questioned MNA Khalid Magsi from the Balochistan Awami Party – an ally of the government. He said that the economic direction of the country was still unclear. “It seems the SBP is lenient on the banks”, said Magsi.
The central bank informed the standing committee that based on the regular monitoring and complaints received from banks’ customers regarding charging higher margins in opening of import LCs, the SBP carried out an assessment of significant increase in foreign exchange income of the banks in the first half of 2022.
It added the significant increase in foreign exchange income was mainly due to the rise in daily volatility of exchange rate, which resulted in the widening of the spreads charged by the banks –a statement that Dr Shah said, indicated that the SBP was defending the commercial banks.
