1,K-P boosts budget for tribal districts,Development outlay for ex-FATA hiked from Rs24b to Rs64b,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has said his government is sincerely working for the uplift of the newly merged tribal districts and developmental budget for ex-Fata has been increased from Rs24 billion to Rs64 billion.
He added that people of Malakand region have rendered great sacrifices for peace and democracy and they would participate with full strength in the upcoming true independence march.
The chief minister announced that he will himself lead the independence march from Malakand which is aimed at achieving the true purpose for which Pakistan was established in 1947.
During his day-long visit to tribal district Bajaur and sub-division Timergara in Lower Dir, the chief minister addressed independence march rallies and inaugurated 18 development projects in Bajaur and eight in Timergara.
While addressing media persons in Bajaur, the chief minister maintained that the ‘imported federal government’ has withheld the budgeted share of K-P province, including the developmental funds of the newly merged tribal districts.
He made it clear that the provincial government has taken up the matter with the federal government through every official means, but to no avail. 
During the tenure of PTI chairman Imran Khan, all the projects were running smoothly and a new era of development was ushered in the tribal districts to bring them on a par with the mainstream areas of the province.
However, the new federal government has halted the release of developmental funds of the province, which is fueling apprehensions of continued exploitation in these areas.
The chief minister maintained that his government regularized the khasadar force and project employees of the tribal districts and is currently funding the Sehat Insaf project in the merged tribal districts from its own kitty. 
During his visit to Bajaur, the chief minister inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of 18 different developmental projects.
He performed the groundbreaking ceremony of 52.5 km approach roads at six different spots, inaugurated the establishment of 12 primary schools, and the up-gradation of six primary, 17 middle and 17 high schools in the district.
He said that the provincial government is sincerely working for improvement of communication links and providing widespread and uniform education opportunities in the merged tribal districts, adding that the foundation stone for the establishment of Bajaur University will also be laid soon.
On the occasion, the chief minister also inaugurated the newly established hockey turf, football ground and hostel in the sports complex at Khar.
He observed that provision of a healthy environment for the younger generation is the manifesto of his government across the province including the newly merged tribal districts.
The inauguration of the newly established Rescue 1122 building was also held on the occasion.

2,Air monitoring stations installed in Balochistan,10 AQMS in the border areas will cost Rs100 million,"The Balochistan government has installed Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) in the province to analyze air quality on regular basis.
Parliamentary Secretary for Environment Mahjabeen Sheran inaugurated the newly installed technology stations.
The provincial government had planned to install 10 AQMS in the border areas with an estimated cost of Rs100 million, an official of the Balochistan government told APP. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has already advertised to appoint technical staff to run the stations to monitor the compliance of environmental laws at development and industrial sites.
Government is taking steps to ensure the installation of all AQMS at the earliest and within the approved funds to protect the environment and curb air pollution in the province. He said the AQMS would be installed at various sites, including Taftan, Chaman, Gwadar, Khuzdar, Hub, Loralai and other locations.
The official said that all available resources would be utilized to protect the natural resources which were necessary for preserving green environment.
The government had given approval for the establishment of the Balochistan’s first-ever environmental laboratory in Lasbela to ensure the protection of environment and marine life.
The environmental research laboratory will help identify and contain the toxic contaminants affecting the quality of water, soil, and air in the province.
It will also provide researchers with a platform to conduct analysis on the effects of industrial waste and its impacts on the environment by using modern tools and technologies.

3,UET serves 2nd notice on professor,Letter states remarks of the professor were defamatory against the minister who is also the Pro-VC of the university,"University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Peshawar on Wednesday served second explanation notice to Associate Professor Dr Sajjad Wali Khan (BPS-20) Department of Civil Engineering over alleged taunting remarks on Twitter against Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Higher Education Kamran Khan Bangash.
A letter issued here said that the remarks of the professor were defamatory against the minister who is also the Pro-VC of the university.
Despite denial of the professor about his remarks against the minister, the UET establishment asked the senior teacher to re-submit his reply within seven days of the notice.
It is to be mentioned here that the associate professor allegedly replied to a tweet by education minister saying that, “Your attention is more on establishment of new university for political gains rather than quality of education. Your government is simply unable to run the existing universities of K-P; destroyed all existing universities of K-P, brought them on the verge of financial collapse, diverted all funds towards UET Swat.”

4,Politicians say K-P govt has lost its writ,"Terrorism on the rise but govt still in denial mode, says ANP","Politicians on Wednesday questioned security arrangements across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) after six policemen were killed in an ambush in Lakki Marwat district of the province.
The banned TTP claimed responsibility for the assault and also released pictures of six AK-47 rifles it confiscated.
Awami National Party (ANP)’s Provincial President Aimal Wali Khan accused the K-P government of ‘facilitating terrorism’ and leaving the entire province exposed to the militants.
He condemned the attack at police van in Lakki Marwat, saying that IGP had claimed a day earlier that the entire province was peaceful but on the very next day a deadly attack happened, which claimed six precious lives.
“The provincial government has been living in a state of constant denial despite the fact that terrorism has been on the rise,” he said, adding that the provincial government was busy fighting a battle to save Imran Khan while the province has been facing an upsurge in terrorism for the past one year.
“Police has emerged as the biggest target for terrorists but still the ‘facilitator government’ is engaged in negotiations and dialogue with militants,” he said. “As a result innocent people are losing their lives,” he added.
“The government should make public the entire so-called dialogue process with TTP otherwise such attacks would continue,” said Wali, adding that local residents in their thousands were holding peace marches to demand a crackdown against militants.
“Swat drama ended after local residents took to the streets against it but now Waziristan has been handed over to the militants,” he charged.
Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) Chairman Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao in a press statement said that government had lost its writ in K-P as no one was safe from the wrath of militants.
