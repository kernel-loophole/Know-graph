Official data shows that dengue fever has taken 41 lives in the province this year, of which bout half the cases have been recorded in Lahore.

6,Lahore’s libraries becoming a relic of the past,Modern technology has wiped out the need for physical copies of books,"Since a significant chunk of the population now has access to the internet, whether it be from a cell phone or a personal computer, traditional methods of reading are fizzling out. 
Consequently, the country’s public libraries, once considered an invaluable resource, are now struggling to keep their doors open. In Lahore, the second most populated city in the country, there are five large libraries - Quaid-e-Azam Public Library, Model Town Public Library, Dayal Singh Trust Library, Punjab Public Library, Defence Public Library Complex, and Reference Library of Lahore Museum. Despite the city having a population of more than 12 million, these five libraries together only have 117,488 members but they are home to more than 613,000 books. 
Habib-ur-Rahman, was deeply engrossed in one of these books at the Punjab Public Library, when he was asked about his opinion on there were barely any people in the library. “When everything is available online in a PDF format, it is unfair to expect libraries to be crowded,” Rahman opinedAn online survey carried out by The Express Tribune, shows that Rahman’s opinion holds weight. 92 percent of the respondents to the survey were of the view that the importance of libraries had dwindled due to modern technology. 
Furthermore, 42 percent of respondents to the survey said that they do not go to libraries, 33 percent said they visit regularly, and 25 percent said they go occasionally. Basheer Bhatti, who is in charge of the Reference Library of Lahore Museum, reflecting on the survey’s results, said that only students, especially those pursuing a PhD, visit libraries now.
“Historical books are studied the most, whereas the literature books sit and collect dust,” Bhatti informed, adding that online access to books had doomed libraries. However, in Bhatti’s experience sometimes he comes across visitors who are genuine book lovers and visit because they love the feeling of holding a book and flipping through its pages. In The Express Tribune’s survey 67 percent of respondents, who visit libraries, said they visit to read a novel or a historical book, while 33 percent said that they go there in search of reference material. Rahman, who himself was looking for reference material, was of the view that students visit libraries for references because it was much more authentic.
“These books are available online but there is always a doubt that the content has been edited. The advantage of the physical books is that the relevant reference is original and can simply be photocopied,” Rahman told The Express Tribune.
