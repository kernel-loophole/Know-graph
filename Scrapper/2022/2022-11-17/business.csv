0,Pakistan’s debt skyrockets to Rs62.5tr,"Debt mismanagement, rupee devaluation, high interest rates push debt to record high","Statistics released by the central bank, on Wednesday, show that Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities peaked, by an unsustainable 24%, to Rs62.5 trillion at the end of September 2022 – pushing the country into unchartered territory.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the total liabilities of the country, mainly government debt, surged by Rs12 trillion, or 23.7%, compared to a year ago.
The figures reported in the central bank’s latest debt bulletin suggest that no political party, neither the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) nor the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), have a solution out of our growing debt problems. With the mounting number of loans, coupled with a lack of resources to repay, the country’s destiny has been placed in the hands of international financial institutions and the global powers.
Now, however, the realisation that Pakistan cannot seem to survive without continued financial support is becoming more apparent to the world powers, creating problems in the political and security spheres.
The central bank did not give the percentage of Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities in terms of size of the economy. The increase in public debt alone, a direct responsibility of the government, was Rs9.7 trillion in the past year. Gross public debt was recorded at Rs51.1 trillion by the end of September 2022, according to the SBP.
None of the three mainstream political parties have managed to bring any meaningful reforms to stop debt accumulation. Instead, in its 43-month rule, the PTI added the largest amount of debt to country ever.
While blaming his predecessors for throwing the country under a pile of debt, former prime minister Imran Khan had promised to curtail debt on priority. When he left office in April 2022, however, his government had mounted Rs19.5 trillion to the federal government’s total debt stock.
During his visits to China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan’s Finance Minister Ishaq Dar pleaded for additional loans so as to meet this year’s gross financing requirements. The government is also in dialogue with foreign commercial banks, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to secure loans.
There was a clear mismatch between the increase in public debt and the budget deficit, showing the adverse impact of the currency devaluation on the external debt stock.
In terms of US dollars, Pakistan’s total external debt and liabilities remained almost unchanged at $127 billion in the past one year due to the soaring ties between Pakistan, the international financial institutions (IFI) and Washington. However, in terms of the rupee, there was a massive surge in external debt due to the currency’s devaluation.
Pakistan’s total external debt jumped to Rs26.5 trillion as of September-end – an addition of Rs6.8 trillion or 35% compared to last year. Excluding the IMF loans, the federal government’s external debt increased to Rs18 trillion within one year. There was a net increase of Rs1.3 trillion in external debt, largely caused by the depreciation of the rupee and the country’s efforts to build foreign currency reserves via borrowing.
Pakistan’s debt from the IMF increased by 44% within one year to Rs1.7 trillion by the end of September, stated the SBP. This is despite the fact that the IMF has disbursed about $2 billion less than its scheduled releases during this period.
The federal government’s total domestic debt increased to Rs31.4 trillion, an addition of Rs5 trillion, or 19%, in one year.
The lower-than-targeted tax collection, steep currency devaluation, high interest rates, rising expenditures along with losses incurred by state-owned companies and debt mismanagement were the main reasons for the surge in public debt.
The average exchange rate on the last day of September 2022 was Rs228 to a dollar due to a depreciation of 57.4% in just one year, according to the central bank. This had a huge impact on the government’s external debt.
The direct consequence of the mounting pile of debt is a huge increase in the cost of debt servicing. In just one quarter of the current fiscal year, debt servicing stood at Rs1 trillion. The government’s revised estimates show that the cost of debt servicing may cross Rs4.7 trillion – about Rs750 billion more than the budgeted figure.

1,‘Artificial stabilisation causes oil industry over Rs7b in losses’,OCAC says industry will not survive if unfair adjustments are not removed immediately,"The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), on Wednesday, protested the government’s attempt to artificially stabilise the price of oil by placing cuts on freight charges, margins and the adjustment of foreign exchange.
The oil industry claims that it has suffered a loss of over Rs7 billion due to the government’s plan to keep oil prices artificially low.
Since the government came into power, it has been working on different formulas to keep oil prices on a lower level. Earlier, the government used the exchange rate. It had developed a formula whereby, it took the average exchange rate, but later revised it to the exchange rate, of the last day of price revision.
The government also staggered the exchange rate loss, allowing the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) to stabilise oil prices.
The OCAC, in a letter to the state petroleum minister, lamented the forced stabilisation of oil prices which was coming at the cost of the oil industry.
The letter stated that, “The price of motor fuels remained unchanged for the second consecutive fortnight of November 2022. This is despite the fact that prices were supposed to increase, based on the government’s approved pricing formula.”
Instead of passing on the increase or absorbing the impact of this increase by reducing the petroleum levy, however, the price was forcefully and unjustly reduced. Oil prices were kept artificially low on some items including freight margin, exchange loss adjustment and denying the passing of the increased margins of oil marketing companies (OMCs).
The oil industry body said that Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM) was reduced by Rs3.21 and Rs2.72 per litre on Motor Spirit (MS) and High Speed Diesel (HSD) respectively.
It further said that exchange loss adjustment was reduced by Rs3.01 and Rs2.11 per litre on MS and HSD respectively.
The letter stated that, “The long pending revision of OMCs’ margin on motor fuels was approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on October 31, 2022. However, the revised margin of Rs6 per litre (increase of Rs2.32 per litre) for both products has not been incorporated in prices till date.”
Based on expected sale volumes for the second fortnight of November, as confirmed in a Product Review meeting chaired by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), the impact of the above unjustified adjustments was calculated to be Rs7.55 billion; this does not include the impact of exchange loss adjustments that have been withheld/ staggered by Ogra since August 2022.
“On behalf of our member companies, we would like to highlight that this forced stabilisation of oil prices at the cost of the industry is not sustainable and will severely impact the already crippled oil industry,” stated the OCAC.
The letter emphasised that the “industry is already facing a severe financial crunch due to high global prices, the depreciation of the rupee, increased LC confirmation charges and high premiums on import.”
The council warned that the industry would not be able to survive if these unfair adjustments are not removed immediately.

2,Sazgar to launch Pakistan’s first hybrid electric car,"‘Haval’ to be launched on November 17, 2022","Leading rickshaw manufacturer, Sazgar Engineering Works Limited (SEWL) announced on Wednesday that it will be launching Pakistan’s first locally assembled hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under the brand name ‘Haval’ on November 17, 2022.
In a notice to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the company said, “We are pleased to inform you that the company has successfully assembled/ manufactured locally the first Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) of Pakistan and is being launched under brand ‘Haval’ as of November 17.”
The global SUV brand, ‘Haval’, is one of four brands belonging to Chinese automaker, Great Wall Motors (GWM) and entered the Pakistani market via Sazgar Engineering Works Limited (SEWL) early 2021.
In July 2021, the company was awarded “Category-A, Greenfield Investment status,” to assemble/manufacture Haval vehicles in addition to the ‘BAIC’ vehicles already being produced. Subsequently, in June this year, Sazgar announced the completion of its manufacturing plant where the Haval would be assembled/manufactured. They further stated that trials would be complete by October 1, 2022.
In August, however, the company released another notification to the PSX announcing that it had completed its trial operations before the stipulated time and that the first CKD rollout of the said vehicles was expected within the same month.
In 2020, the government approved the Electric Vehicle Policy 2020-25, aiming to see electric vehicles capture 30% of all passenger vehicles and heavy-duty truck sales by 2030, and 90% by 2040.

3,Pine nut exports offer locals potential to get rich,Fresh and dried nut exports to China rose to $47.7m in Jan-Sept,"The price of half a kilogramme of Pakistani pine nuts in China can be as high as RMB 140 (about Rs4,360), which is at the upper end of the so-called “chain of contempt” of nuts.
Pakistani pine forests are found in valleys at an altitude of 2,000-3,350 metres in the mountainous western areas on the border with Afghanistan.
Sulaiman Range in Balochistan, Sherani and Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Diamer in Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) are the main production regions for pine nuts.
A farmer in Diamer said that 200,000 to 250,000 people are engaged in the pine nut business here and every household earns income from it.
According to official data of the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC), in the first nine months of 2022, Pakistan’s exports of pine nuts in shell to China amounted to $47.69 million, over five times the value of $9.5 million for exports of fresh or dried nuts in 2018.
“Pakistani pine nut exports offer the locals a huge potential to earn a living and get rich,” remarked Faisal Ahsan Pirzada, Secretary of Forest, Wildlife and Environment Department, G-B, in an interview with China Economic Net (CEN).
Haji Ghulam Mehmood from Chilas pine nut market agreed and said that the money earned by pine nut exports is settled in US dollars, which is beneficial for Pakistan.
As for the reason behind cutting down the “money tree”, which is a gift of nature, G-B Senior Minister Raja Zakirya Khan Maqpoon told CEN that cutting down the pine trees must be stopped in the underdeveloped areas like Diamer, as forests are their only source of income.

4,Consumers brace for gas outages,Gas may be supplied for only 8 hours a day on SNGPL’s network in December,"Domestic consumers are bracing for long hours of gas outages as they are likely to receive supplies for only eight hours a day to meet cooking needs when the winter season hits its peak next month.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the main problem would be encountered on the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited’s (SNGPL) network, particularly in Punjab, due to the scarcity of gas.
Punjab’s own gas production stands low when compared with other provinces which include Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Sindh and Balochistan.
Under Article 158 of Pakistan’s constitution, gas producing provinces have the first right to consume their own production.
Therefore, in the peak winter, the energy situation may be better in other provinces but the domestic consumers in Punjab will be worse off as they will be getting gas for cooking purposes in the morning, afternoon and evening for limited hours.
According to sources, the gas supply has so far been better in the ongoing month. However, it is feared to decline sharply with harsh weather next month.
SNGPL’s network, which covers Punjab and K-P, would be facing a shortfall of 300-400 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) from December 2022 to March 2023, sources said.
Therefore, it will be forced to slash supplies to the domestic consumers, captive power plants of industries and compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations.
The CNG sector in Punjab has already faced restrictions on domestic gas supply and relies on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), but it is not readily available due to the failure of Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) to procure spot cargoes.
In December, the CNG stations in K-P may also experience supply curbs if the situation deteriorates in the wake of rising gas demand.
According to sources, there will be no disruption in the provision of gas to the processing industry, however, supplies may be cut to the captive power plants in peak winter.
At present, the total number of gas consumers in Pakistan is 10.65 million. Of these, Punjab has 6.43 million consumers and K-P 997,904 consumers. In Sindh, the consumers are calculated at 2.92 million while Balochistan has 304,468 consumers.
Over the past many years, the gas supply has deteriorated with no major discoveries and fast depletion of existing reserves. Estimates suggest gas flows will drop further and go down to 1,659 mmcfd in 2029-30.
According to industry experts, after a major discovery in the Qadirpur field before the year 2000, there have not been any big finds in the country.
Owing to the rapid depletion of natural gas reserves, the cheap gas-based power plants have remained under-utilised.
At the same time, in utter disregard to the dearth of locally produced gas, the gas schemes of parliamentarians have continued to win over voters in their constituencies. This has resulted in a hike in gas prices and further shortfall in flows.
The shortage has also caused the shutdown of industrial sector that is the backbone of the economy.
So far, no government has set its priorities right for better use of gas, which can be diverted to the power plants for supply of cheaper electricity to the consumers.
Experts point out that Pakistan has a vast electricity network and the government should give priority to the power sector in gas supply.
Earlier, the imported LNG was provided to consumers like captive power plants and fertiliser producers at discounted rates. But now the expensive LNG is not available in the country due to its rising demand internationally in the wake of Russia-Ukraine war.
“The government should immediately stop piped gas supply to the domestic consumers and provide liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at concessionary rates to save the precious resource for expansion of the industrialisation base and boosting exports,” an expert suggested.

5,World Bank to provide $1.3b emergency relief,Financial support being offered to subsidise urea for farmers,"The World Bank on Wednesday said that it was planning to provide Pakistan with $1.3 billion for emergency, agriculture and housing relief in the wake of devastating floods, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of National Food and Security.
During a meeting with the Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Tariq Bashir Cheema, World Bank Regional Director for Sustainable Development John A Roome said, “The World Bank will provide financial support to subsidise urea for the flood and rain affected farmers. The funds will be released after approval from the international lender’s board meeting in December.”
Appreciating the timely support, the federal minister said that floods have resulted in colossal losses, especially for the farming community. “The gravity of the disaster was completely unforeseen. Now, the farmers need a helping hand and we are trying our utmost to provide relief and assistance, and help them in rehabilitation,” he said.
The minister assured his ministry’s full support for the World Bank’s projects and initiatives in Pakistan.
“Providing relief to the farming community will also help in achieving food security in the country,” said Cheema.
Speaking on the occasion, Additional Secretary Mohammad Asif informed the World Bank official that the database of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) could be used to identify farmers for the targeted subsidy. He added that the National Flood Response Coordination Centre (NFRCC) had also developed a digital application which could also help in making relief deliveries to the farmers.

6,Ethiopia set to launch direct flights,"Addis Ababa, Islamabad aim to raise bilateral trade to $300m","Pakistan and Ethiopia have geared up to strengthen bilateral ties as they are working to launch direct flights, establish formal banking channels and boost trade to at least $300 million.
Earlier this year, Ethiopia opened its full-fledged embassy in Islamabad, though the two countries had established diplomatic relations 64 years ago in 1958.
“Ethiopian Airlines, the largest airline of Africa, is set to operate direct flights between Addis Ababa and Karachi,” announced Ethiopian Ambassador Jemal Beker Abdula while addressing a press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday.
Background information suggests the airline will start flying directly between the two cities for two days in a week from late December 2022 or early January 2023.
At present, the bilateral trade value is nominal at $7 million to $8 million a year. “We have set a very ambitious target to increase trade to $300 million in the first year,” Abdula said.
He revealed that Pakistan’s pharmaceutical products and medical equipment would be the two major import goods for Ethiopia. Besides, Pakistan can also export its textile products.
On the other hand, Ethiopia produces the best coffee in the world, which keeps “people very active throughout the day”, the envoy said. “It also produces high-quality tea, while Pakistan is one of the top tea importers in the world.”
Pakistan could also import agricultural products from Ethiopia, he pointed out. “We aim to produce clean energy equipment as well as Ethiopia produces 90.4% of clean energy, mostly from hydel projects.”
Technology and innovation as well as battling climate change were the big areas of common interest for the two countries. They should join hands to make progress in those areas, he stressed.
“Pakistan is set to open a bank branch in Ethiopia in the next two to three months,” announced Ethiopia Consul General Ibrahim Khalid Tawab. “We are holding meetings with Pakistani private banks these days,” he said.
The consul general revealed that he would lead a delegation to Ethiopia in January 2023 and urged businessmen from all sectors to come onboard to explore the new export market.
He emphasised that Pakistan needed to tap new export markets in the East and diversify its focus from the West. “Finding new export markets can help Pakistan get rid of the IMF loan programmes.”
He urged the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) to hold a single-country exhibition of Pakistani products in Ethiopia to help find new buyers. “Pakistan produces high-quality construction material. It can find importers there,” he said.
Besides trade, the two countries were also focusing on strengthening relationship in the fields of tourism and technology, Tawab said.

7,Ideas 2022: AI is the future of Pakistan,"Ministers urge universities, youth to play key role in its research and development","The exponential growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) witnessed globally mandates that Pakistan also keep pace with the latest technological advancements through research and development. In this regard, universities can play the key role of serving as institutions for research, creativity, collaboration and combining the expertise of different stakeholders.
These remarks came on the second day of the seminar ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Defence Market: A Paradigm Shift in Military Strategy and National Security’, organised as part of IDEAS 2022. During the discussion, the need to transform Pakistan into a global hub for AI, data science, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality and other emerging technologies was also conferred.
Acknowledging Pakistan’s progress in the industrial and defence sectors driven by AI and machine learning (ML), the Federal Minister for Defence Production, Muhammad Israr Tareen said, “The country can become a global hub for AI, data science, cloud-native computing, edge computing, blockchain, augmented reality, and IoT by reshaping and revolutionising education, businesses and research through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies and AI-driven applications.”
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication, Syed AminuI Haque said, “In December 2022, Pakistan is going to launch 5G, which is essential for all IoT devices to run at par with the standard speed.”
“5G will also help with e-health, ecommerce, e-education and industry in general. To promote IoT, the ministry has recently opened an IoT regime that allows companies to acquire licences at moderate amounts of Rs 20,000,” he added.
“IoT can help bring increased efficiency in sectors ranging from textiles to the defence industry. However, it cannot work without access to a fast, secure internet connection. Therefore, the government has planned to launch 5G internet, to enable IoT devices to function properly,” explained Haque.
“After bringing IoT to the country, the second aspect required is the connectivity to operate it. For that, the government, in collaboration with the private sector, has installed 180,000 kilometres (about 111846.81 mi) of fibre optics,” he elaborated.
“The authorities are close to bringing all the mobile phone operators for network sharing. Under this agreement, the subscriber identity module (SIM) card holder of one company will be able to run the internet of another company. For example, if a Telenor user visits an area where its internet service is not strong, but that of Ufone is robust, then the user can opt to pay a small fee and shift to Ufone to use the internet,” Haque commented.
“For this purpose, the government has initiated 65 broadband projects, worth around Rs72 billion, in all four provinces; 70% of these projects are near completion and will benefit 35 million people through increased connectivity, including those in rural areas that are either underserved or unserved,” he stated.
While highlighting the role of academia, research scholars and data-savvy individuals in development, the minister for defence production emphasised that, “The country’s talented youth should be provided opportunities in the field of AI and new trends of Industry 4.0, through initiatives like the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC)”.
“Apart from its social and economic impact, developments in AI have also changed the dynamics of modern warfare,” explained Tareen, adding that, “With such strategic shifts, the concept of security has widened beyond traditional understanding. This poses new challenges to nation states.”
The Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) Chairman, Khalid Rahman noted that “Universities have served as key platforms to set the pace for humanity in the areas of culture, economics, technology and, more particularly, in the field of AI, which impacts every other field of life.”
