0,"Three months on, NA panel laments lack of flood data",The committee expresses dissatisfaction over non-availability of accurate data regarding flood survivors.,"ISLAMABAD: More than three months after unprecedented floods devastated almost one-third of the country, a parliamentary panel on Wednesday bemoaned that the federal and provincial disaster management agencies had operated in a vacuum of data about actual needs of affected people and provision of relief and rehabilitation support.
The committee expressed dissatisfaction over non-availability of accurate data regarding flood survivors, said a terse statement issued by the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance & Revenue.
Presided over by Qaiser Ahmed Shaikh, the PML-N MNA from Chiniot, the committee meeting expressed displeasure over the absence of NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik.
The committee, comprising members of all coalition partners in the absence of opposition PTI, criticised the government for its failure in controlling the currency depreciation and other economic challenges.
While discussing the post-flood relief and rehabilitation activities, PPP lawmaker from Sindh Dr Nafisa Shah said a lot of aid material was pouring in from NDMA, PDMAs, charities and armed forces, but it was in a hotchpotch manner and without proper assessment as to who and how many needed shelter, food or medicines and how to provide them with required things and support.
She said there were people who might be getting tents, food and other support multiple times, but at the same time many still awaited supplies. “Now dumping (of material) is going on,” she said, adding that the federal and provincial agencies should coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.
PML-N member and former federal minister Birgis Tahir said Dr Nafisa’s constituency should be taken up as a test case to ascertain if government’s relief machinery was able to reach out to the affected people. He said large swathes of land were still under water in Sindh where people were looking for water pumps to flush out standing water while human misery was taking its toll.
Committee Chairman Qaiser Shaikh agreed his own visit to Sindh had revealed a very tragic humanitarian situation.
Sabir Hussain Qaimkhani, MQM member from Hyderabad, told the committee that it emerged during a coordination committee meeting, led by Federal Minister Khursheed Shah, that even the funds approved by the federal government to support flood-affected families had been given on the basis BISP data that covered the ‘deserving people’, who were overwhelmingly other than the ‘affected people’.
Dr Nafisa said the NDMA said 150,000 people were affected in Khairpur area but then 9,000 blankets or tents had been provided there. She said there was a complete mess on the ground and if 500 tents were supplied, 5,000 people were running to fetch them. She said given the sowing season, agriculture support by the government should be extended in a systematic manner.
Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on Finance Tariq Bajwa assured the panel that interest on loans to farmers in flood-affected areas had been waived by ZTBL while the government and the commercial banks were also sharing on the 50:50 basis the interest cost on agriculture loans.
Separately, he said, the government was also working with microfinance banks to introduce a similar scheme for landless farming families. The panel was also briefed about the actions being taken by SBP against treasuries of eight banks that earned exorbitant profits in exchange rate fluctuation.

1,Joyland cleared for screening after cuts,ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday clea­red a controversial but critically acclaimed film Joyland —...,"

ACCORDING to the head of the censor board, the film can be screened “from tomorrow if they wish”.—AFP

 
ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday clea­red a controversial but critically acclaimed film Joyland — Pakistan’s official entry for Oscars 2023 — after omitting some “objectionable and immoral” scenes from it.
An eight-member review committee set up by the prime minister on Tuesday “cleared the film after deleting some objectionable scenes in it”, Hafiz Tahir Khalil, a senior journalist who was part of the committee, told Dawn.
Salman Sufi, head of the Prime Minister’s Strategic Reforms, also confirmed that the government had decided to clear the film for release after a second review by the committee. “Freedom of speech is a fundamental right and should be nourished within ambits of the law,” he tweeted.
Joyland, directed by Saim Sadiq, won the Un Certain Regard Jury Prize and the unofficial Queer Palm at Cannes in May. It was then submitted to the 95th Academy Awards, to be held in March, as Pakistan’s official entry for the international feature film award.
According to the Academy, the film needs to be in cinemas for at least seven days before Nov 30 to remain a contender.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed an eight-member committee to look into complaints that the film was “against social and moral norms” and recommend follow-up action.
The committee concluded that certain scenes needed to be edited out of the film and decided to clear the film for release. However, the government did not immediately withdraw the notification of its ‘uncertified’ status.
However, Muhammad Tahir Hassan, head of the Central Board of Film Cen­sors, told AFP news agency late on Wednesday that “there is no hindrance from the board for its screening”. He said: “The distributors can screen the film from tomorrow morning if they wish.”
The committee was for­med after a massive outcry on social media at Joyland’s censorship certificate being withdrawn. The film was passed by all censor boards in the country but fell into trouble after complaints were filed to the Central Board of Film Censors.
The Ministry of Infor­mation and Broadcasting recently cancelled the film’s exhibition licence and the federal government declared Joyland “uncertified” after receiving complaints.

2,"Reko Diq mining deal ‘favourable’ for Balochistan, SC told","Balochistan will receive $32 billion during 47 years of mining life in the area under the joint venture agreement, counsel says.","ISLAMABAD: The counsel for Balochistan told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the reconstituted Reko Diq joint venture agreement was an exceptionally good deal for the province, which would stand to reap substantial benefit from the project.
“Not only will the province get 25 per cent share in the project, but also 5pc royalty, besides uplift project and economic development through corporate social responsibility with zero risk and negligible cost,” emphasised Advocate Salahuddin Ahmed before a five-judge SC bench that had taken up a presidential reference.
In addition, he said, Balochistan will receive $32 billion during 47 years of mining life in the area.
Justice Yahya Afridi, a member of the bench, asked if there was any provision in case other precious minerals were discovered during excavation, or would the company only be restricted to copper and gold.

Counsel says Barrick Gold enjoys exclusive rights in case of discovery of other minerals

The counsel replied that Barrick Gold Company (BGC) would enjoy exclusive rights in case of the discovery of other minerals.
“So essentially it is an open-ended deal,” Justice Ijazul Ahsan said.
Justice Jamal Mandokhel wondered what would happen if someone challenged this exclusivity in the future.
“That is why we are before the Supreme Court,” the counsel said, explaining that in view of the regional security concerns, it was imperative to have the presence of security agencies in the area, but within the mining area, the investor would be responsible for the security of its installations.
Salahuddin Ahmed explained that out of the 25pc share of Balochistan, the provincial government would hold direct control of 10pc share, whereas the rest of 15pc would be held offshore holding companies, which would also be owned by Balochistan.
Also, the provincial government would have the access, scrutiny and audit of the accounts of these holding companies, the counsel explained, adding that it was a requirement of the financing companies that the entire process should be done through offshore companies.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, who was heading the bench, observed that financial and legal auditing should be of international standards.
The counsel, however, assured the court that Balochistan would have oversight and the right of audit of all processes in the project.

3,Taliban visit fails to solve Chaman border issue,Sources say that Kabul and Islamabad are in contact with each other on the issue of the border closure.,"QUETTA: The Friendship Gate at the Pak-Afghan border could not be opened for a fourth consecutive day, as efforts for reopening of the border failed on Wednesday.
Sources said a delegation of the Afghan Taliban administration visited Chaman and condoled with the Pakistan security officials over the death of a soldier of the Frontier Corps who embraced martyrdom when armed men opened fire at the Friendship Gate on Sunday.
The Afghan Taliban during their stay at the Friendship Gate held talks with the Pakistani officials deployed at the border. They expressed their grief over the death of the soldier, terming it an unfortunate incident.
The sources said that Kabul and Islamabad were in contact with each other on the issue of the border closure. However, no progress was reported regarding the opening of the border until the Taliban hand over to Pakistan the people involved in the firing.
Meanwhile, the return of Pakistani and Afg­han families to their respective countries was completed.
“We allowed all Pakistanis to come back to Chaman from Afghanistan who produced required legal documents, which proved their Pakistani nationality,” a senior official of the Chaman administration told Dawn, adding that the border was completely closed.
“We are awaiting instructions from Islamabad about the opening of the border with Afghanistan,” the official said.

4,Joint sitting of parliament put off once again,This is for the fifth time that the speaker has delayed the joint sitting.,"ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Spe­a­ker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on Wednesday once again put off the joint sitting of parliament, scheduled to be held today (Thursday), for another month without giving any reason as the two houses of parliament, according to an official announcement, will now meet on December 20.
The notification in this regard said the speaker had delayed the joint sitting exercising his “powers conferred by proviso to Rule 4 of the Parliament (Joint Sittings) Rules 1973”.
This is for the fifth time that the speaker had delayed the joint sitting, which had been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi on May 26, without assigning any reason. 
The last joint sitting of the parliament was held on October 11 in which the government had carried out a routine legislative work and passed three bills — Dyslexia Special Measures Bill 2022, Trade Organisations (Amendment) Bill 2022 and the Islamabad Capital Territory Domestic Workers Bill 2022. After accomplishing the task, instead of proroguing the joint sitting, the speaker had announced adjournment till Nov 18.
On Oct 6, the government, however, convened a special joint session for the mandatory presidential address and Dr Alvi had delivered his speech amid boycott by the treasury and the opposition members.
President Alvi had in the past remained a target of severe criticism by the previous opposition parties, now sitting in the government, for allegedly undermining the parliament by issuing a record number of ordinances under the PTI government.
The present National Assembly, which has come into existence as a result of the July 25, 2018 general elections and which saw a change of regime through a successful no confidence resolution against the then prime minister Imran Khan in April, has already entered its last parliamentary year after completing its four-year term.
While President Alvi, who belongs to PTI, had refused to administer the oath to PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif after his election as prime minister in April, he later took the oath from the cabinet members appointed by Mr Sharif.
Parliamentary experts believe the government is dragging the joint sitting, fearing that President Alvi may not convene a fresh session under PTI’s influence if the PML-N-led coalition government decides to do some crucial legislation before the next general elections, due in October 2023.

5,Climate finance commitments must be honoured swiftly: Sherry,KARACHI: Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Wednesday called for international monetary ...,"KARACHI: Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Wednesday called for international monetary commitments on loss, damage and adaptation due to climatic changes “to move faster than the speed of the glaciers melting in Pakistan”.
She was speaking at a high-level ministerial event on “Loss and Damage: From Intention to Action”, organised by the Pakistan government at the UNFCCC pavilion. The event was conducted with high-level panelists from all over the world.
Ms Rehman said: “By the time the funds come to us, our climate needs change faster than the pace of funds released. From disaster recovery to a resilient future, the missing link is financed and its dispersion, making sure that it reaches those who literally have to keep their heads above water.”
She added: “As we navigate the finish line of intense negotiations at COP27, one thing is clear: climate finance is now at the heart of the climate emergency, whether it is achieving the Paris Goal of 1.5C, or delivering on adaptation and resilience goals.”
She said the country required climate resilience funds that can be accessed with speed and scale. “Right now, all climate funding is very slow to access, nor is it available for the kind of rebuilding needed. The relief funds that came via a UN flash appeal were crucial for saving lives but they cannot help us rebuild,” she said.
Emphasising the urgency of climate finance needs, Mr Rehman said long-term climate financing instruments are needed to plug severe capacity deficits in the developing countries right now as the protracted periods of pipelining funds lose potency when resilience needs change faster than the speed of resource dispersion.
“What has happened in Pakistan will certainly not only stay in Pakistan,” she warned, and called for “long-term climate financing instruments” to plug severe capacity deficits in developing countries. “Financial pipelines must be created to facilitate swift transfer of funds to countries in the Global South that are reeling from climate shocks,” she said.

6,Pakistan floods ‘10th costliest disaster’ in a decade,"Floods have inflicted an estimated $3bn loss, caused over 1,700 deaths and displaced 8m people.","THE calamitous Pakistan floods of 2022 were the tenth most expensive climate disaster to have buffeted a nation over the last decade, according to risk modelling firm RMS.
The floods inflicted an estimated loss of $3 billion on the country, caused over 1,700 deaths and displaced eight million people.
Poor countries like Pakistan, which saw around eight million people displaced, often bear the brunt of devastating weather events, RMS said in its observation.
The firm carried out a survey to rank the 10 biggest natural disasters to have hit humanity over the last decade.

The survey was carried out in the backdrop of deliberations at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt last week to hammer out a “loss and damage” mechanism that would determine, in monetary terms, the extent of destruction suffered by a country due to climate change. 
The summit also discussed measures to disburse money to poor countries to enable them to cope with the aftermath of a disaster.
The costliest disaster of the past decade was the California wildfires of 2017-18, with damages estimated to be around $328.5bn. This was followed by the Atlantic hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean in Aug-Sept 2017, which caused losses of $297bn. The Australian bushfires of 2019-20 cost $110b.
This year’s Hurricane Ian that struck Florida in Sept 2022, Hurricane Ida that struck Louisiana, New Jersey and New York in Aug 2021, floods in Germany and Belgium in July 2021, Japanese typhoons Faxai and Hagibis from Aug-Oct 2019, this summer’s European heatwave and the North American heatwave from summer 2021 were also on the top ten.
