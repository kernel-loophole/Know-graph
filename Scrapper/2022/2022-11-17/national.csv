0,Arshad Sharif's murder was an 'inside job',Mavenjina sees a 'well-planned' operation by 'well-trained' shooters,"The mystery surrounding renowned journalist Arshad Sharif's 
murder continues to evade conclusion as emerging information adds to the shock.
Amidst reports of the senior anchorperson being tortured prior to his death, another piece of information came to the fore on Thursday.
Sharif was shot dead on the outskirts of Kenya's Nairobi city on October 23.
Kenyan Human Rights Commission's (KHRC) Senior Programme Adviser Martin Mavenjina, speaking to a local news outlet, said that the murder investigation hinted at an ""inside job"" and that Sharif was under surveillance for a while.
He countered the claims of ""mistaken identity"", wondering how the security agencies knw the journalist would be at a specific spot at a particular time.
The rights advocate accused the Kenyan police of unlawful killings and enforced disappearances.
 
He pointed out that when a complaint is filed with the police, they are given a complete description of the vehicle, and Sharif was travelling in a V8 Land Cruiser, a car usually used by VIPs.
He pointed out the difficulties of taking a headshot in a moving vehicle, pointing out that the circumstances hint at this being a ""well-planned"" effort by ""well-trained"" shooters.
He went on to explain that roadblocks were placed there for a reason, adding that people are told that they would have their IDs checked at road blocks, but this did not happen in the journalist's case.
The KHRC official pointed out how Sharif's murder showed an ""outright disregard"" for human rights and country's constitution, which guides the police to protect rights.
He went on to highlight the global corruption ranking of Kenyan police, adding that they killed more people than coronavirus itself during the first six months of the epidemic.

Last week, a private TV channel, citing Arshad's post-mortem reports, claimed that the senior journalist was brutally tortured for hours before being shot dead.
The journalist hosting the show also claimed that Arshad was shot at close range and that this was not a case of mistaken identity but a 'planned murder'.
He further claimed that the slain journalist’s fingernails were pulled out and his fingers and ribs were broken during torture.
The senior journalist, on his show, further stated that around '10 American instructors and trainers' were present at the shooting range on the day of Sharif's murder.
Earlier, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said evidence suggested Sharif was the victim of a targeted killing in Kenya, not an accidental shooting, though he still needed more information on the incident.
Kenyan police spokesman Bruno Shioso declined to respond to the minister's comments on the death of the TV journalist.
A police report a day after the shooting said police officers hunting car thieves opened fire on the vehicle that Sharif was travelling in as it drove through their roadblock without stopping.
Shioso said the case was now being investigated by the police watchdog, the state Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA). A spokesperson at the IPOA did not immediately respond to calls and a message seeking comment.
The government had formed an investigation team to look into the matter, which caused uproar in the country. The minister said the team had returned from Kenya, but Kenyan police had not yet given Pakistani investigators all of Sharif's recovered belongings.

1,Who Pakistan picks as army chief matters far beyond its borders,The incoming army chief could potentially play a key role in lowering the political temperature,"Pakistan's nuclear armed military is set to get a new supremo later this month when General Qamar Javed Bajwa's tenure as Chief of Army Staff comes to an end.
The military is the most powerful institution in a nation seldom far from its next crisis and the appointment could have a crucial bearing on the future of Pakistan's fragile democracy, and whether relations with neighbouring India are allowed to improve.
During the 75 years since independence and formation of Pakistan out of the Partition of India, the army has seized power three times and directly ruled the Islamic republic for more than three decades, fighting three wars with India along the way.
The new chief could set the tone for the conduct of relations with the Hindu nationalist government in India, the Taliban in Afghanistan, and determine whether Pakistan tilts more toward China or the United States.
Bajwa's legacy
Appointed chief in 2016, Bajwa sought to balance ties with China and the United States. While Islamabad moved closer to Beijing, Bajwa also worked to thaw relations with Washington, with whom he worked closely during the evacuation of Kabul in 2021 when western forces pulled out of Afghanistan.
Bajwa also took an active interest in economic matters. He made highly-publicised visits to Beijing and the Middle East - helping to secure financial assistance for Pakistan. He also lobbied Washington to help strike a deal with the International Monetary Fund.
He even summoned Pakistan's top industrialists to a meeting at army headquarters to encourage them to pay more tax.
During his tenure, India and Pakistan fought air skirmishes in 2019, but he was a public proponent of better ties and avoided escalation when tensions ran high, such as when an Indian missile accidentally crashed into Pakistan's territory this year.
In early 2021, Bajwa sanctioned a restoration of a ceasefire agreement with Delhi in the disputed region of Kashmir.

How is a chief appointed?
The outgoing chief will give the prime minister a list of senior-most generals to choose from. Only on rare occasions has the baton been passed to someone outside the top four most senior officers in an army that, with just under a million personnel in 2019, was the sixth largest in the world.
An army chief's tenure is for three years, but they often obtain extensions, as did Bajwa. Despite assurances by the military that Bajwa will retire this time, there has been speculation that he could be given another extension due to the latest political and economic ructions in Pakistan.
The generals regarded as front-runners to replace Bajwa are Lieutenant-Generals Asim Munir, the army's quartermaster general and a former spy chief, Sahir Shamshad, commander of the Rawalpindi Corps, Azhar Abbas, the army's chief of general staff, and Nauman Mahmood, chief of the National Defence University.
Why it matters globally?
Pakistan's army chief will play a key role in managing risks of conflict with nuclear-armed rival India on its eastern border, while dealing with potential instability and friction with Afghanistan on its western frontier.
Many world capitals, including Washington and Beijing, have direct ties with Pakistan's military, given the country's strategic location in a volatile neighbourhood, and a coastline close to major shipping lanes serving the oil-rich Gulf.
Internal security has been a near-constant problem due to insurgencies in ethnic Pashtun and Baloch regions.
Despite all the risks, Pakistan and its military have dismissed foreigners' concerns over the command and control, and security of its nuclear weapons.
Why is this appointment important domestically?
The military has long been accused of manipulating the democratic process to maintain its dominance. Nineteen of Pakistan's 30 prime ministers were elected, but not one of them completed their five-year terms.
Having recently admitted to its past meddling in politics, the army has said it would no longer interfere. Whether the new chief stands by that commitment could be key to Pakistan's democratic evolution.
Pakistan is in the midst of another bout of political uncertainty as Imran Khan has led country-wide protests in an attempt to force Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif into early elections.
The incoming army chief could potentially play a key role in lowering the political temperature as Pakistan attempts to survive an economic crisis and recover from historic floods.

2,SC overrules registrar’s objections on G-B CM plea,Judge notes matter of governance and attendant issues had been dealt with in CAA case,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday overruled the registrar office objections on a petition that challenged the appointment of a judge as well as the extension given to three judges of the Gilgit-Baltistan’s chief court by the Pakistan government, noting that questions raised in the plea relating to the governance of area needed to be addressed.
Earlier, G-B Chief Minister Khalid Khursheed Khan had filed a constitutional petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution through senior lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan and made the federal government, G-B governor and newly-appointed Judge Chief Court Javed Ahmed respondents.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had given an extension to three judges of the G-B Chief Court on September 16 following a summary moved by G-B Governor Syed Mahdi Shah. However, the summary was initiated without consulting the chief minister.
Later, the registrar’s office returned the petition by raising seven objections. In the meanwhile, the G-B CM challenged the objections by filing an appeal in the chamber, which was heard by Justice Munib Akhtar.
""I conclude that prima facie (which suffices for disposing of Chamber Appeals of the present nature) the office objections cannot be sustained,"" said a four-page order issued by Justice Munib Akhtar while deciding the appeal in the chamber on Wednesday.
The judge noted that the matter of governance in G-B and attendant issues, including the availability of fundamental rights to the people, had been dealt with in Civil Aviation Authority case.
""There can be no doubt that access to justice and the independence of the judiciary are fundamental rights, the enforcement of which can be sought in appropriate cases by petitions either before the High
Courts under Article 199 or this Court under Article 184(3),"" the order read. ""Matters relating to or arising out of the Order in relation to GB, especially questions relating to the enforcement of fundamental rights, are prima facie not within the remit of any High Court and this Court is therefore the appropriate forum for pursuing the same,"" it added.
""The questions raised in these constitutional petitions relate also (and/or are tied directly or indirectly with or to) fundamental questions relating to the governance of GB, which may also need to be addressed, only strengthens my conclusion that prima facie the office objections are without merit.""
The order noted that the office objections are overruled.
“The constitutional petitions are to be registered and numbered and fixed in court as per the procedure and practice of the Court. If, and when, notice is issued to the respondents (or they choose to voluntarily appear before the Court) they will of course be entitled to raise all such points and objections as available to them in accordance with law, including any relating to the maintainability of the petitions.""

3,Pakistani among seven hanged in Kuwait,Amnesty International urged a halt to the executions,"Kuwait put seven people to death for murder on Wednesday, the public prosecutions service said, as the first executions since 2017 went ahead despite appeals from a prominent rights group.
One Ethiopian woman and one Kuwaiti woman were among those hanged, along with three Kuwaiti men, a Syrian and a Pakistani, a statement said.
The executions are the first since January 25, 2017, when the oil-rich Gulf country also hanged a group of seven people, including one member of the royal family.
They come only days after Saudi Arabia said it had executed two Pakistani nationals for smuggling heroin, ending a nearly three-year hiatus in executions for drug crimes.
In a statement late on Tuesday, Amnesty International urged a halt to the executions, calling them ""the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment"".
Kuwaiti ""authorities must immediately establish an official moratorium on executions"", Amnesty's deputy regional director Amna Guellali said in a statement.
Capital punishment is widespread in the Gulf region, particularly in Iran and Saudi Arabia, where 81 people were executed in a single day in March, drawing international condemnation.
Kuwait has executed dozens of people since it introduced the death penalty in the mid-1960s. Most of those condemned have been murderers or drug traffickers.
In April 2013, Kuwaiti authorities hanged three men convicted of murder. Two months later, two Egyptians, convicted of murder and abduction, were executed.
Courts in Kuwait, which has an elected parliament and an active political scene, have in the past handed down death sentences to members of the Al-Sabah family that has ruled the country for two-and-a-half centuries.
""While the Kuwaiti authorities have a duty to bring those responsible for serious crimes to justice, suspects must be tried in accordance with international law in trials that meet Kuwait's international human rights obligations,"" Guellali said.
""The authorities must immediately establish an official moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty entirely,"" she added. AFP

4,Pakistan plans JF-17 third generation production,Fighter jet was part of PAF fleet that downed two Indian aircraft in Feb 2019,"Pakistan has initiated work to introduce the third version of the fighter jet JF-17 Thunder which was part of Pakistan Air Force's (PAF) fleet that downed two Indian aircraft in retaliation to New Delhi's aggression in February 2019.
The country has put the second version of the aircraft on display in the ongoing four-day (November 15-18) International Defence Exhibition and Seminar (IDEAS 2022) at Expo Centre in Karachi.
The fighter jets demonstrated their capability and enabled PAF’s pilots to demonstrate their professionalism in February 2019.
""PAF pilots flying JF-17 Thunder downed two Indian aircraft and caught Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Abhinandan (Varthaman),"" an official of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex Kamra-Pakistan recalled while throwing light on key features of the fighter jet.
Pakistan invented the jet in collaboration with China and inducted it into the PAF in 2007. It was first upgraded in 2015.
""Further upgradation is in progress,"" the official added.
Tanks upgraded to fire missile
Pakistan has showcased its latest battle tank called Haider, ""which is capable of firing a laser-guided missile with an effective hitting target range of 5 kilometres,"" said an official of Heavy Industries Taxila at its stall setup at IDEAS 2022.
""This is the most advanced battle tank introduced after the Al-Khalid tank.""
Haider was introduced in the recent past and inducted into the Pakistan Army fleet. ""This has improved the capability of Pakistani forces on battlefields,"" he said.
The tank is also capable of going into hiding by generating smoke when it senses a counterthreat. This is an auto gear tank with the steering to move it right and left, replacing the old technology of sticks to do so, he said.
Warfare system
Global Industrial and Defence Solutions (GIDS) officials said they have invented the Integrated Electronic Warfare System which helps forces to sense, protect and communicate within a radius of 30-35 kilometres.
""We have produced the system at the one-fourth cost against what Pakistan used to pay to import it earlier,"" a GIDS official said.
The communication system works on radio signals. It improves the capabilities of the forces in combating against enemy's aggression.
Bomb disposal robot
National Radio Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC) has introduced robots having the capability to defuse bombs on the battlefields.
The robot is part of an EOD (explosive ordinance device) vehicle, which also carries other equipment to defuse bombs including bomb disposal suits for army personnel.
Anti-ship cruise missile
GIDS has also launched its first indigenous anti-ship cruise missile Harbah-NG for exports.
It is an all-weather, ship-launched Subsonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile with a range of 290km that can target enemy ships and land-based installations.
It has been designed to maintain a low‐altitude, terrain‐following flight profile which makes it capable of successfully evading the enemy’s countermeasures during the operational mode. It is offered in both air and ground-launched variants.
The recent launch has enlisted Pakistan among those few countries which are capable of selling cruise missile technology in the international market.
IDEAS brings together international manufacturers and suppliers of products and services to explore opportunities for cooperation in the field of defence production through joint ventures, outsourcing, and collaboration.
Over a period of time, IDEAS has turned out to be the region’s major platform for the promotion of defence systems as it exhibits a wide variety of products, ranging from equipment used in third-world countries to the most sophisticated technology from the west.
IDEAS 2022 has surpassed all previous milestones in terms of space, booking, exhibitors and delegates both domestic and foreign.
Karachi Expo Centre has been booked to its capacity with more than 500 exhibitors from Turkey, China, North America, South America, Europe, Asia and the Far East of which 60% are international and 40% local.
Besides trade visitors, more than 285 high-level delegates from 64 countries are visiting the exhibition.

5,Imran narrows fight to free polls,Senior PTI leader claims party chief’s latest statements on relations with the US and establishment are no U-turns,"With every passing day, as the “Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) March” inches towards Islamabad, PTI chief Imran Khan is narrowing his fight down to free and fair elections all the while keeping his guns trained at the “corrupt ruling elite”.
In order to achieve this goal, it was deemed important to mend fences and clear the air on any misgivings and bring down the fronts the party has opened for itself, a senior PTI leader revealed to The Express Tribune.
The leader claimed that Imran’s latest statements on relations with the United States and establishment were no U-turns. He said these statements, especially regarding America, were in conformity with what the former premier had been saying for the past several years – of forging ties with other countries on mutual respect.
He said PTI’s current stated position on both the issues was to clear the air and lessen the number of fronts that it had opened for itself, adding that the party would be able to achieve nothing by keeping too many “balls in the air”.
PTI’s main demand is fresh elections and there will be no compromise on it, he noted.
The party leader maintained that Imran had never desired to appoint a man of his choice as the new army chief, noting that he only spoke about upholding merit in the appointment process for the purpose.
He said the PTI believed that the incumbent government would not appoint an officer on merit, rather they would want someone, who would continue providing them with the support they need to keep the alliance intact and more, to be appointed as COAS. However, we are leaving this appointment issue to the government, he added.
When asked about the change in the PTI position, he said, “let this be a test for this government”.
The party leader hoped that the stance adopted by the PTI on the appointment of new army chief would be reciprocated by the government.
Read PTI to requisition PA session
He stressed on moving forward with a focussed target and observed that the PTI chairman’s statements regarding the US were “distorted by the press”.
In a meeting with journalists in Lahore on Wednesday, Imran had reportedly said that he had taken a backseat on the issue of appointment of the army chief.
It is pertinent to mention here that during the start of the ongoing movement, the PTI had objected to the appointment of the army chief by the incumbent regime and demanded fresh elections with the process of COAS appointment to be put off until a new “legitimate government” was sworn in.
Imran, reportedly hinted at even agreeing to the possibility of extending the tenure of the incumbent chief, saying he would not have any issue if the COAS stayed till a new government took oath.
Recently, during an interview with a foreign publication, Imran said that he no longer blamed the US for his removal from power. Later, the PTI chief maintained that a section of local media tried to “twist” his statement to please the incumbent government.
During the interview with the foreign publication, Imran on his ouster said, ““As far as I’m concerned it is over, it’s behind me. But whatever US desired could not have happened without people here who actively took part in the conspiracy to get rid of me, so US is not be blamed in that sense…”

6,Balochistan to get $32b in 47 years from Reqo Dik,Lawyer tells SC 25% of proceeds gained from project belongs to provincial govt,"The lawyer representing the Balochistan government on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that the province would receive $32 billion in 47 years from the Reqo Dik project.
Salahuuddin Ahmed further told a five-judge larger bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial -- hearing a presidential reference on the project -- that 25% of the proceeds gained from the gold mine project belonged to the provincial government.
Of this 25% share, 15% would be held by a holding and offshore company of Balochistan, he added.

CJP Bandial inquired when the project would be completed.
To this, the lawyer replied that 2.5 years would be spent on preparing the feasibility studies of the project.
Work on the Reko Diq project would be kicked off in the next five years after that, he added.
The lawyer informed the court that companies from China, Japan and Russia also approached for the country for the Reko Diq projec. However, he added that these companies were not willing to pay the $9 billion fine imposed on Pakistan.
Justice Ijazul Ahsan inquired what was the case against Pakistan in the International Centre for Dispute Resolution and International Criminal Court.
Salahuuddin replied that the International Center for Dispute Resolution had a case against the Pakistani government for breach of contract.
In the International Criminal Court, he added, the Balochistan government faced a case for  violation of agreement.
The lawyer warned that If Pakistan did not sign an agreement by December 15, the affected company would take legal action against the country.
Justice Yahya Afridi inquired about the lease of other minerals that would be extracted from Reqo Dik apart from gold and copper.
The lawyer responded that the lease for all the minerals extracted from Reqo Dik apart from gold and copper was held by the Barrick Gold Corporation as well.
The CJP inquired asked whether or not the financial transactions involved in the Reko Diq agreement would be international in nature.
The lawyer replied that the financial transactions for the project would be carried out through offshore companies.
As time was running out, the hearing of the case was adjourned till Thursday (today).

7,‘One Network’ catches the eye at IDEAS-22,Project aims at fulfilling telecommunication requirement of country,"Participating of the International Defence Exhibition and Seminar 2022 (IDEADS-22) evinced keen interest in the ‘One Network’ project of the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) the on the second day of the mega event at the Expo Centre in Karachi on Wednesday.
The ‘One Network’ is an advanced communication project, under which 3,000 kilometres of underground fibre optic cable is being laid along the motorways across Pakistan. After the completion of the project, it would meet Pakistan's telecommunication requirements.
According to the One Network chief operating officer (COO), 2,000 kilometres of fibre optic cable haf been laid under the motorways communication infrastructure. People traveling on the motorways would get relief from the rush situations. It would also eliminate cash payments at toll plazas.
The system would also be linked to the motorway police to keep check on any violation of the traffic rules, such as wearing of seat belt and the speed limit. Besides, in case of emergency, people would get timely recovery or rescue assistance.
The ‘One Network’ covers M1 to M16 Motorways in Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Pindi Bhattian, Multan, Sukkur, Karachi, Hyderabad, Sialkot, Dera Ismail Khan, Swat and Hazara, besides the Lahore Ring Road and Lahore-Faisalabad route.
The FWO is also conducting six diploma courses. According to the principal of this project, Col (retd) Atif, about 45 short courses of three to six months of duration were also offered. The graduated from here were associated with technical fields in Pakistan and other countries.
Meanwhile, during a seminar titled ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Defence Market: A Paradigm Shift in Military Strategy and National Security’ as part of IDEAS-22, artificial intelligence (AI) experts underscored the essential role of universities to keep Pakistan abreast with advancements in this field.
The seminar was orgnaised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), Islamabad, and the Defence Export Promotion Organization (DEPO), where Minister for Defence Production Israr Tareen was the chief guest, said a press release issued here.
Addressing the seminar, Tareen acknowledged the country’s progress in the industrial and defence sectors, driven by the AI and machine learning (ML). He also underscored the role of academia, research scholars, and data-savvy individuals in the development process.
“Pakistan can become a global hub for AI, data science, cloud-native computing, edge computing, block-chain, augmented reality, and the IoT by reshaping and revolutionising education, businesses, and research through adoption of cutting-edge technologies and the AI-driven applications,” he said.
He emphasised that the country’s talented youth should be provided opportunities in the field of the AI and the Fourth Industrial Revolution [Industry 4.0] through initiatives like the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC).
“Apart from social, political, and economic changes, advanced technologies, 5G, and the AI have also changed the whole dynamics of contemporary warfare, battlefields, tactics, and strategies, the minister told the participants.
“With such strategic shifts, the concept of security has widened beyond conventional terms and rudimentary procedures to include sophisticated mechanisms and technology-driven procedures. These pose new challenges to the states,” he said.
IPS Chairman Khalid Rahman, who delivered the introductory remarks, highlighted the role of human intellect and research in the process of development. “In this regard, universities have served as the key platforms to set the pace for humanity in the key areas,” he said.
“The progress in AI will not stop and no country should stay behind in the AI development,” he emphasised. The role in AI progress is essentially played by universities, where research, creativity, and collaboration … can not only capitalise on the potentials of AI but also deal with the challenges.”
To meet the new complex security challenges of the 21st century, the other speakers presented their research papers, ideas, and findings on different AI-driven applications and processes, upon which the future international security dynamics depend.
Lt-Colonel Dr Ghulam Murtaza, Dr Yasar Ayaz, Dr Muhammad Tayab Ali, Maj Aon Safdar, Dr Waleed Bin Shahid, Lt-Col Usman Zia and Sqn-Ldr Javeria Farooq also addressed the seminar. The session was followed by a discussion by the panel.

9,SC summons record of punishments in NAB references,PTI counsel asks court to protect basic human rights; contends corruption damages trust in public office,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday summoned 23 years’ worth of record from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) regarding punishments handed down in references since its formation — from 1999 to 2022 — on PTI chief Imran Khan’s plea challenging the amendments to accountability laws.
A three-member SC bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah heard the case.
The apex court has sought the records of the punishments in the NAB references till Friday.
During the course of proceedings, PTI lawyer Khawaja Haris, while continuing the arguments, said that a public official is a holder of public trust and can be held accountable.
He contended that corruption committed by public officials breeds mistrust and damages public trust in the office and reiterated that fundamental human rights were being directly violated by the NAB amendments.
He furthered that he was only underscoring the constitutional provisions about the court’s responsibility to protect fundamental human rights, adding that his argument was not premised on incorrect assumptions but on what the constitution said.
The PTI lawyer recalled that the Supreme Court had struck down the Contempt of Court Act 2012 and declared it unconstitutional and illegal. He argued that the contempt of court law was thrown out by the court on the incompetence of the legislators for violation of human rights.
At this, Justice Ijazul Ahsan asked whether the counsel was implying that the law made against basic human rights can be struck on for the incompetence of parliamentarians.
Meanwhile, CJP Umar Ata Bandia noted that the said act was invalidated due to its partiality and not because of incompetence.
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah asked where was it written that the law was invalidated due to the lack of competence of parliament. ""The court rejected legislation against fundamental rights but never said that the parliament lacked competence, the court never questioned the competence or competence of the parliament,"" he stressed.
The CJP noted that it was not written anywhere but was taken as a matter of understanding, recalling that in the case of fake bank accounts, fundamental human rights were linked to public trust. However, he remarked that the NAB case was different.
Khawaja Haris prayed the court to ascertain whether basic human rights in the case should be protected or not, the court should see.
Subsequently, the court adjourned the hearing of the case  till November 17
