• Exchange of fire with militants near Afghan border claims two soldiers’ lives
• PM, KP CM, interior minister express grief over attack on policemen
LAKKI MARWAT / BAJAUR: Eight law enforcement officials, including six policemen and two soldiers, were martyred in two separate incidents in Lakki Marwat and Bajaur districts on Wednesday.
The first incident occurred in the Kurrum Par area of Lakki Marwat in the morning when militants opened fire on a police van, killing six personnel, including an assi­stant sub-inspector (ASI). The attack was later claimed by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in a statement.
An official said a team of the Abbas police checkpost was on its way to the Wanda Shahabkhel area to perform security duty at a weekly cattle market when militants opened fire on their van with sophisticated weapons from multiple sides, killing six law enforcers on the spot.
He said the area where the attack took place was surrounded by mountains and bordered Karak district.
“The martyred policemen included ASI Ilm Din, lower head constable Parvez Khan and constables Ali Usman, Dil Jan, Ahmad Nawaz and Mehmood,” the official said, adding the police van was also damaged in the attack. The assailants later fled with the weapons and bullet-proof jackets of the martyred policemen.
After hearing the gunshots, villagers rushed to the crime scene and could be seen covering the bodies with pieces of cloth in video clips shared on social media.
The official said a large contingent of police, led by district police chief Ziauddin Ahmed, reached the spot and launched a search operation for the attackers.
“Police chased the attackers in the mountainous terrain and succeeded in seizing their motorcycles and also recovered the bullet-proof jackets they had made off with,” he claimed. He further said the law enforcers found blood at the militants’ hideout, indicating some of the assailants might have been injured in retaliatory fire by the policemen.
The bodies were shifted to the police lines located in the district headquarters complex of Tajazai where their funeral prayers were offered.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police (IGP) Moazzam Jah Ansari told journalists that such attacks could not shatter the strong resolve of the police force to eliminate terrorism.
“In the recent months, the Lakki Marwat police have eliminated several terrorist groups, and today’s attack on policemen proves that [terrorists] are taking their last breaths,” he maintained. He added that a comprehensive strategy was being formulated to ensure complete elimination of militants and sustainable peace and harmony.
IGP Ansari said the resources of the Lakki Marwat police would be reassessed and any shortage of personnel, weapons and vehicles fulfilled.
“Local residents are enlightened, educated and peace-loving and they will not allow miscreants to destroy peace in their district,” he stressed, asking the local elders to attend jirgas instead of coming out on roads for peace, and persuade people to cooperate with the police to completely eliminate militancy.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and KP Chief Minister Mehmood Khan condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred policemen.
“The nation salutes the sons who sacrificed their lives for the motherland,” the PM said, adding the entire nation stood firm with an unbreakable resolve against terrorism. He also expressed sympathies with the families of the martyrs.
CM Khan took notice of the incident and sought a report from the provincial police chief. “The incident is very tragic and the sacrifices of the martyrs will not go in vain,” he stated.
Soldiers martyred
Meanwhile, two soldiers were martyred and a militant killed in a clash near the Pak-Afghan border area in the Charmang region of Bajaur district.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations said the security forces and militants exchanged gunfire early on Wednesday morning in the Hilal Khel area near the Afghan border. During the intense battle, the statement said, a militant was killed, and weapons and ammunition seized from him. The killed attacker was actively involved in terrorist activities against security forces in the region, the statement said.
During the exchange of fire, it said, Naik Taj Muhammad, a 33-year-old resident of Kohat; and Lance Naik Imtiaz Khan, 30, from Malakand were martyred.
On the other hand, regarding the killing of four of their members in Dera Ismail Khan district on Tuesday, the TTP claimed they were targeted by a drone before a raid.

1,Minister ‘confirms’ plans to amend army act,"""Media hype over amendments is uncalled for; govt not considering any major changes,"" says Khawaja Asif.","• Former defence secretary says proposed law seems tailored to army chief
• Govt already able to ‘retain’ retiring officers of Lt-Gen rank and below, as evident from Shuja Pasha’s extension
ISLAMABAD: Even though Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday attempted to downplay the debate on a leaked proposal to amend the army act, the revelation has laid bare the ongoing behind-the-scenes power struggle, ahead of the impending appo­intment of a new army chief.
The wide-ranging amendments proposed in the Pakis­tan Army Act (PAA) 1952 pertain to an array of subjects rel­a­ted to the army’s functioning, structure, command, and terms and conditions of service.
However, amendments to Sec­tion 176 are currently the centre of attention, especially the insertion of the words “ret­e­ntion” and “resignation” in sub-section 2(a) of the same clause.
A casual reading of this specific amendment in the current scenario, wherein one of the contenders for the coveted post is scheduled to retire a couple of days before the chief’s position falls vacant, would suggest that a provision is probably being created to pull up the transition in a manner where the complexity involved in making an appointment is removed.
But that may not necessarily be the case.
 
 

The amendment was originally proposed by General Headquarters, as per the Defence Ministry’s Summary for the Cabinet Committee for the disposal of Legislation Cases (CCLC) and, on the face of it, seems to be meant to achieve the goal of getting Gen Bajwa to continue.
According to a retired defence secretary, the government or any of the services can technically retain any of retiring officers of the rank of lieutenant general and below for as long as they are required, without needing any new legislation.
The former secretary, who did not want to be named, said the plan to ‘retain’ seemed to be meant for none other than the incumbent army chief.
It is clear that the positions taken by the ruling allies and the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf have made the choice of the new commander quite tricky: if one candidate is picked, there is a chance that one of the political parties may try to discredit that appointment in public.
This is something the military can ill-afford at this juncture, when some of its senior officers are facing relentless criticism in the political domain.
This is the context in which the proposal to get Gen Bajwa to continue in office until after a new government is installed, seems to have emerged. The idea is that the new government then picks who would be the next army chief.
Until a few weeks ago, PTI chief Imran Khan was a leading proponent of this idea, but even he seems to have readjusted his views on the appointment and no longer seems keen to force his opinion on the appointment process.

On Wednesday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif contended in a tweet that the proposed amendments package was required as per the Supreme Court verdict of 2019, which had called for legislating on the tenures of the services chiefs.
 






Timeline
Now comes the question of how serious the government is about the legislation proposed by GHQ. The summary shows that the proposal was sent by the defence ministry to the cabinet committee, which is the first port of call for any legislative proposal, on Nov 1. Since then, more than a fortnight has passed without a meeting of the CCLC.
When contacted by Dawn on Wednesday, three key federal ministers expressed complete ignorance about the proposed legislation, indicating that it had yet to be circulated among the members of the executive body.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s sudden detour to London on his way back from Sharm el-Sheikh on Nov 8 and his extended stay there also explains the government’s reluctance to do the needful. Reports from London had, at that time, indicated that PML-N leader Mian Nawaz Sharif was averse to Gen Bajwa staying in the job.
A federal minister, on the condition of anonymity, also said that the amendments in the army act may not happen before the change of command.
The defence minister also seemed non-committal about the scope of the amendments and the timeline for legislation, saying that no major changes in the army act were being considered and whatever amendments were to be carried out, would be done in “due course”.
Gen Bajwa, who continued his farewell tour as he visited the Malir Garrison in Karachi on Wednesday, also seems to have read this. But the struggle between the government and the military on the next chief is far from over.

2,Centre rejects Punjab-led JIT on Wazirabad shooting,"Court says no to second FIR, directs investigators to record petitioner’s account instead.","LAHORE: Amid the ongoing controversy surrounding the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed to probe the attempt on former premier Imran Khan’s life in Wazirabad, the Centre has rejected the new team formed by the Punjab government and suggested that it reconstitute the body by giving intelligence officials a role to ensure fair investigation.
In a strongly-worded communique sent to the Punjab government on Wednesday, the federal government said it would not accept a ‘controversial’ police officer, Ghulam Mahmood Dogar, who had allegedly violated the orders of the establishment division in the past, as head of the JIT.
While the Ministry of Interior letter also raised some legal flaws in the new JIT constituted by the Punjab government, a sessions court in Wazirabad, in the meantime directed the same JIT to record the version of the petitioner and decided that a separate FIR of the shooting was not needed on the basis of new information.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Qasim Ali Bhatti observed in his order: “After registration of an FIR, the investigating officer is to embark upon an exercise to discover the actuality of the matter irrespective of the version of the incident narrated in the FIR.” He explained that every new information received by the investigating officer or every new circumstance in which the relevant offence was committed coming to his notice did not require registration of a separate FIR. The court then disposed of the petition filed by PTI-Lahore secretary general Zubair Khan Niazi.

Court says no to second FIR, directs investigators to record petitioner’s account instead

In its letter to the Punjab government, the interior ministry stated that the constitution of the JIT under Section 19(1) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 requires inclusion of an officer of any other investigation agency, including an intelligence agency. The federal government pointed out that the JIT comprised five members, all belonging to the Punjab police, without representation of any other investigation agency/intelligence agency in the violation of the ATA.
“Moreover, it has been observed that Ghulam Mahmood Dogar, the Lahore CCPO who has been appointed as convener of the JIT had been suspended vide establishment division’s notification issued on Nov 5, but later temporarily restored by the Federal Service Tribunal,” the letter read.
It stated Mr Dogar had been involved in controversies and his appointment would not inspire confidence of general public. “In view of the aforesaid it is clear that the JIT constituted by the Punjab government is in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Act ibid as not only there is no representation any other investigation agency, including an intelligence agency but the appointment of controversial police officer who is facing disciplinary proceedings and is temporarily restored, as convener of the JIT will further compromise the fairness of the inquiry,” the letter added.
The interior ministry stated the reconstitution of the JIT within a span of six days did not reflect well in terms of the fairness of investigation. “It would, therefore, be appropriate for the Punjab government to constitute a JIT for a case of such sensitivity which should comprise police officers with a proven track record of professional competence, experience and integrity and also include representatives of Intelligence Bureau and ISI in line with Section 19 (1) of the ATA 1997 to ensure that the ends of the justice are met”, the letter advised.
JIT to take suspect’s custody
However, Lahore CCPO Dogar set aside the federal government’s concerns and called the first meeting of the JIT as its head late on Wednesday evening. An official source said the meeting was also attended by other members and it was decided to plan a visit of the crime scene in Wazirabad, take custody of the prime suspect who fired shots and also record statements of witnesses.
He said the JIT meeting also discussed many other possible leads to trace the true culprits behind the failed assassination attempt on the former premier. He said the medical examination reports of injured Imran Khan and other persons would also be examined at the next meeting.

3,Imran claims he’s taken a ‘step back’ on chief’s appointment,"“I want that the new army chief’s appointment should strengthen Pakistan Army,” says PTI chief.","LAHORE: PTI Chairman Imran Khan has ‘stepped back’ from the issue of new army chief’s appointment and said “we are looking at the process from the fringes”.
Speaking to senior journalists at his Zaman Park residence and later virtually addressing the party’s long march rallies in Jehlum, Sargodha and Mardan on Wednesday, the PTI chief regretted that PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, a convict and an absconder, as well as former president Asif Ali Zardari, would be taking the most important national security decision of new army chief’s appointment.
He claimed that their personal interests clashed with national interests.
“I am not talking about those, amongst whom an army chief be appointed, but about those who will take decision about the appointment against the most sensitive position in the country.”
Sources say Mr Khan’s decision to ‘step back’ from the matter gives an impression of his discontentment over the failure of PTI’s backchannel talks with the establishment, which were being spearheaded by President Dr Arif Alvi.
The president had last week admitted that there was no breakthrough in backdoor talks he was holding with all political players as well as the powers that be to find a workable solution to end the chaos. On Wednesday, Mr Alvi conceded that he was “engaged with political and relevant stakeholders” in an attempt to bring them on the negotiating table so that they thrash out a consensus on the major issues facing the nation.
Referring to reports that the incumbent government had decided to bring changes in the Army Act, Mr Khan said: “I fear that the duo (Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari) would damage the state institutions for their personal interests. I want that the new army chief’s appointment should strengthen Pakistan Army.”
Analysis: It's not over till it's over
Talking to the senior journalists, he said Nawaz Sharif wanted that only such an army chief be appointed who should look after his financial matters and cases. He, however, hastened to add that “no army chief will go against the state, state institution and masses”.
The former premier said he did not have any animosity towards Washington but wanted positive, better and strong relations between the US and Pakistan. “I will always consider Pakistan’s interests supreme over my personal interests,” he said.
Mr Khan yet again appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to get Arshad Sharif, Senator Azam Swati and his own assassination attempt cases under his watch and dispense justice to all.
Dialogue with government
Imran Khan told media persons that he had received a message to hold dialogue with a government committee and said he had flatly refused it. “Dialogue only after the announcement of the date of fresh general elections.”
In his address to the long march participants, the PTI chief said his party was holding the march against installation of thieves in the government through a conspiracy, when they were about to be convicted by NAB and the FIA in a Rs1,100 billion corruption case. Eventually, those thieves were given ‘NRO’ through amendments to the NAB law.
‘Important appointment’
Without naming any institution or individuals, President Alvi said in his discussion with journalists at Governor House that consultations were under way about “an important appointment in November”. 
Although the statement issued after the meeting by the Press Information Department did not name the office of the “important appointment”, Dr Alvi was apparently referring to the appointment of the next army chief.
“He said an important appointment falling in the month of November should pass exactly as envisaged under the Constitution and relevant laws. However, in his opinion, the appointment might be made in consultation with the relevant stakeholders,” the PID statement added.

4,Imran vows legal action over Toshakhana sale claims,"• PTI chief announces intention to sue media group, ‘buyer’ in Pakistani, UK, and UAE courts • Minister says Imran must face...","• PTI chief announces intention to sue media group, ‘buyer’ in Pakistani, UK, and UAE courts
• Minister says Imran must face ‘transparent probe’ over sale of pricey wristwatch
LAHORE / ISLAMABAD: A day after Dubai-based businessman Umar Farooq Zahoor claimed that the PTI government had allegedly sold an expensive watch to him for $2 million, PTI Chairman Imran Khan vowed to take legal action against the businessman, the TV channel which aired the interview and anch­orperson Shahzeb Khanzada.
In a tweet, the former prime minister expressed his displeasure with the interview, exclaiming “Enough is enough.”
He accused Mr Khanzada of being supported by “handlers” to slander him [Imran] through “a baseless story cooked up by a known fraudster & internationally wanted criminal”.
Mr Khan said he had spoken to his lawyers and planned to sue Jang/Geo and Mr Khanzada in Pakistan and London, while Mr Zahoor will be taken to a court in the UAE.
Earlier, while addressing a rally via video link from his residence at Zaman Park in Lahore, the PTI chairman said all items taken from the Toshakhana were sold in Islamabad, and the receipts of their sale were present in the repository. “When the case will reach the witness stage, these will be finished forthwith,” he claimed.
The PTI chief alleged since his ouster, the PML-N and Jang/Geo group were continuously launching “malicious campaigns” against him. “The PML-N, Jang/Geo, and CEC [ECP chief] nexus was busy trying to prove that he had done something wrong,” he claimed and referred to the foreign funding case — later converted into prohibited funding case — as well as the Toshakhana case.
The PTI chairman said that he would also launch a defamation suit against the chief election commissioner in the funding case.
In response to the tweet of the PTI chief, Geo anchorperson Shahzeb Khanzada wrote on Twitter: “Thank you Khan sb for taking the legal route for once. My program is available for you to give your version but I’m happy to reply to you in the court as well.”
Demand for accountability
PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz also responded to the PTI chief on Wednesday and asked for ‘receipts’ of the sale of the gifts.
“Who was the buyer of the watch, tell the name. How was the money brought to Pakistan?” she asked.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the former prime minister must face a transparent probe for selling the wristwatch. He said the PTI government had “manipulated the law to buy the Toshakhana gifts on 20 per cent value”.
He claimed that the dates on which the wristwatches were sold in the market were also manipulated and called for a probe. The minister underscored that the individuals involved in the sale of the gifts should record their statements during the investigation.
Imran’s defence
Earlier in the day, PTI leaders – Fawad Chaudhry, Shireen Mazari, and Zulfi Bukhari – held a presser in Islamabad to defend their party chief against the allegations levelled by Mr Zahoor.
Fawad Chaudhry claimed that the coalition government could not find a single case of corruption against Imran Khan, so they had to prepare the Toshakhana case. Speaking about the gift received by Imran Khan, Mr Chaudhry said it was deposited with the Toshakhana and a receipt was issued as well. The value of the gift was evaluated by Cabinet Division and the prime minister was subsequently informed.
He said that the value of the gift was evaluated to be Rs100 million and Mr Khan had paid 20 per cent of the total value and retained the gift. He said Mr Khan had sold the gift for Rs57 million in Pakistan and mentioned it in his tax returns.
The PTI leader claimed that the local purchaser who bought the gift from Imran Khan went to Dubai because of government harassment and sold the gift to Mr Zahoor. However, the PTI leader refused to reveal the name of the purchaser.
According to the PTI leader, the ex-PM did not sell the watch to Umar Zahoor, nor did he hand it over to Farah Khan. He claimed Mr Zahoor was “notorious” in Dubai while three of his brothers were in jail as well.
The PTI leader claimed that Mr Zahoor had named ex-accountability czar Shahzad Akbar because of an old dispute. He added that Mr Zahoor’s name was placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) during the tenure of the PTI and a case was registered against him at the Kohsar police station.
However, the name was removed from ECL by the incumbent government a month ago, he claimed, adding that the interview by Mr Zahoor was an attempt to return the favour. It is worth mentioning that Mr Zahoor had claimed that Barrister Akbar had introduced him to Farah Khan and told him that she wanted to sell watches.
During the press conference, Zulfi Bukhari claimed that Farah Khan did not visit the office of Umar Zahoor and challenged him to produce video footage of her visit if that was indeed the case. He claimed that Mr Zahoor showed an evaluation of $12 million, dated Nov 15 2022.
“The fact is that Mr Khan sold the watch for Rs57 million to a dealer and that dealer sold the watch for Rs61 million. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) threatened him [the dealer], due to which he fled to Dubai,” he added
