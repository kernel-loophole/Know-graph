0,‘Not appropriate’: China’s Xi scolds Canada’s Trudeau in public spat at G20 summit,Video showed Xi upbraiding Trudeau after details of a discussion between the two leaders were leaked to the media,"Chinese President Xi Jinping scolded Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in an on-camera dressing down at the G20 summit, an unusual public spat that could further complicate the strained relations between the two countries.
Footage recorded by reporters at the Bali conclave for world leaders on Wednesday showed Xi upbraiding Trudeau after details of a discussion between the two leaders were leaked to the media.

Trudeau had on Tuesday raised with Xi the issue of what he called Chinese ""interference"" with Canadian citizens after Ottawa in recent weeks accused Beijing of meddling with its democratic and judicial systems.
In the one-minute video clip recorded on the sidelines of the Indonesian summit, Xi tells Trudeau through an interpreter: ""Everything we discussed has been leaked to the papers. That is not appropriate.""
Speaking evenly and wearing a slight smile, Xi says: ""And that's not the way (our discussion) was conducted, was it?
""If there is sincerity, we can have conversations based on an attitude of mutual respect. Otherwise, the results will be unpredictable,"" he adds, looking directly at Trudeau.
Xi then appears to try to walk past Trudeau, but the Canadian leader replies: ""In Canada, we believe in free, open and frank dialogue, and that is what we will continue to have.
""We will continue to look to work constructively together, but there will be things we disagree on,"" he tells Xi.
Raising his hands, Xi cuts him off, saying bluntly: ""Create the conditions. Create the conditions.""
He then broadens his smile, barely looking at Trudeau as he shakes his hand and leaves his counterpart to make his way out of the room.
It is not clear when, if ever, Xi becomes aware that the conversation is being filmed.
'Awkward position'
The tone was akin to ""a great power speaking to a less-great power"", said Van Jackson, senior lecturer in international relations at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.
""Xi's language and body posture was not at all unusual for government officials who are on less than friendly terms -- in private,"" Jackson told AFP.
Tensions between China and the United States put Canada in an ""especially awkward position"", he said, adding that Ottawa's ""embeddedness in the network of Anglo-Saxon, intelligence-sharing democracies all but ensures it will draw China's ire more and more as time passes"".
Xi's Tuesday meeting with Trudeau was the first face-to-face dialogue between the two leaders since 2019.
Canadian federal police said last week they were investigating so-called police stations set up illegally by Beijing in the North American country.
Trudeau also said last week China was playing ""aggressive games"" after Canadian broadcaster Global News reported on a ""clandestine network"" of federal election candidates funded by Beijing.
Relations between the two countries plunged into a deep freeze when Canadian authorities arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in 2018 for allegedly flouting US sanctions on Iran.
Beijing later detained two Canadian citizens in China, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, in what critics called a tit-for-tat response.
Meng and the two Canadians were released last year after lengthy negotiations.

1,"India's Modi, Britain's Sunak meet at G20, discuss ways to boost trade","Modi said ""robust ties"" with the United Kingdom were of great importance to India","Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he met his British counterpart Rishi Sunak at the Group of 20 summit in Bali on Wednesday and discussed ways to boost trade between the two countries.
It was the first meeting between Modi and Sunak, who is of Indian origin, since he became British prime minister in October.
Earlier on Wednesday, Sunak's office said Britain was negotiating a trade deal with India, which if agreed would be the first of its kind New Delhi would have made with a European country.
""They looked forward to the agreement of a UK-India free trade deal, which has the potential to unlock investment and increase jobs in both our countries, as well as expanding our deep cultural links,"" Sunak's office said in a statement.
Modi said ""robust ties"" with the United Kingdom were of great importance to India.
""We discussed ways to increase commercial linkages, raise the scope of security cooperation in context of India's defence reforms and make people-to-people ties even stronger,"" Modi said on Twitter after the meeting.
The two-day summit on the Indonesian island was the first time G20 leaders met since Russia's February invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"".
After Indonesia, India will have the year-long G20 presidency, beginning on Dec. 1.
Modi also met Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, among other leaders at the summit on Wednesday.

2,Hundreds visit Turkish companies' stalls at IDEAS 2022 defense fair,"Mini drones, light weaponry and specialized apparels remain magnet for visitors and foreign delegates","Hundreds of local and foreign delegates and visitors thronged Turkish companies’ stalls on the second day of a major defense fair being held in Pakistan’s southern port city of Karachi on Wednesday.
Some 28 of Türkiye's top defense manufacturers are showcasing their military hardware at the four-day fair that began on Tuesday.
They include STM (Savunma Teknolojileri Mühendislik ve Ticaret A.S), Roketson, Meteksan, ASFAD, Makin eve Kimya Endustrisim, Tualcom, and others.
Nearly 300 international defense manufacturers from 32 countries, along with over 260 delegates from 64 countries are taking part in the defense exhibition, a leading defense expo in South Asia.
The biennial event billed as ""IDEAS 2022,"" is taking place after a gap of four years as the 2020 fair could not take place due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Together with China, Türkiye has the largest representation at the fair.
Kamran Tessori, the governor of southern Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, and Major General Arif Malik, the director general of the country's defense exports promotion authority, also paid a visit to the Turkish pavilion.
Tessori, who expressed interest in Turkish defense products during his visit, hoped that Ankara's ""huge"" participation in the fair would open up new avenues for mutual cooperation in the defense and security sectors.
Mini drones attract visitors
Turkish defense companies are displaying a wide range of products, from military hardware to tactical mini-UAV systems to light weaponry to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity solutions.
Mini drones (mini-UAV systems) at the STM’s pavilion, however, remained the center of attraction.
“We have never seen (military) drones from such a close range before. They are simply impressive,” Arif Jameel, a retired government official who visited the Turkish pavilion with family, told Anadolu Agency.
“And I have never seen such huge drones before,” his wife, attired in a black gown and matching scarf, said in a lighter tone as an STM official briefed a group of Pakistan Army officers on the technology and operation of drones.
A variety of “superior arms” such as hand guns, light and heavy machine guns, and specialized apparels produced by Canik – a group of five defense companies – also attracted a good number of visitors.
Ahmet Salih Erdem, a deputy general manager of Tualcom Elektronik, which deals with communication and RF technologies, said his company has got a “positive” response from both local and foreign delegates.
Erdem told Anadolu Agency that his company is exhibiting several cutting-edge defense products, including the world's smallest anti-jamming CNSS System, telemetry, flight termination, and electronic warfare-related products.
Can Gursoy, an official of Meteksan – one the largest defense industry companies in Turkiye – told Anadolu Agency that local and foreign visitors have shown interest in the company’s products, particularly the radar systems, perimeter surveillance systems, laser and electro-optic systems, and communication systems.
The company also develops underwater acoustic systems and simulators, he added.

3,"Republicans win US House majority, setting stage for divided government",The victory gives Republicans the power to rein in Biden's agenda,"Republicans were projected to win a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, setting the stage for two years of divided government as President Joe Biden's Democratic Party held control of the Senate.
The victory gives Republicans the power to rein in Biden's agenda, as well as to launch potentially politically damaging probes of his administration and family, though it falls far short of the ""red wave"" the party had hoped for.
The final call came after more than a week of ballot counting, when Edison Research projected Republicans had won the 218 seats they needed to control the House. Republican victory in California's 27th Congressional district took the party over the line.
The party's current House leader, Kevin McCarthy, may have a challenging road ahead as he will need his restive caucus to hold together on critical votes, including funding the government and military at a time when former President Donald Trump has launched another run for the White House.
""Americans are ready for a new direction, and House Republicans are ready to deliver,"" McCarthy said on Twitter.
The loss takes away some of Biden's power in Washington but on Wednesday he congratulated McCarthy and said he would work across the aisle to deliver results.
""The American people want us to get things done for them,"" Biden said in a statement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement House Democrats ""will continue to play a leading role in supporting President Biden’s agenda - with strong leverage over a scant Republican majority.""
Democrats have been buoyed by voters' repudiation of a string of far-right Republican candidates, most of them allies of Trump, including Mehmet Oz and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania's Senate and governor's races respectively, and Blake Masters in Arizona's Senate contest.
Even though the expected ""red wave"" of House Republicans never reached shore, conservatives are sticking to their agenda.
In retaliation for two impeachment efforts by Democrats against Trump, they are gearing up to investigate Biden administration officials and the president's son Hunter's past business dealings with China and other countries - and even Biden himself.
On the international front, Republicans could seek to tamp down U.S. military and economic aid to Ukraine as it battles Russian forces.
THE TUG OF INFLATION AND ABORTION
The United States returns to its pre-2021 power-sharing in Washington, with voters tugged in opposite directions by two main issues during the midterm election campaigns.
High inflation gave Republicans ammunition for attacking liberals, who won trillions of dollars in new spending during the COVID-19 pandemic. With voters seeing their monthly grocery, gasoline and rent bills rising, so rose the desire for punishing Democrats in the White House and Congress.
At the same time, there was a tug to the left after the Supreme Court's June ruling ending the right to abortion enraged a wide swath of voters, bolstering Democratic candidates.
Edison Research, in exit polls, found that nearly one-third of voters said inflation topped their concerns. For one-quarter of voters, abortion was the primary concern and 61% opposed the high-court decision in Roe v. Wade.
In the Los Angeles mayoral contest, Edison projected that Democrat Karen Bass, a top progressive in Congress, had defeated Rick Caruso, a billionaire former Republican who ran on a platform of reducing crime and homelessness in the city. She stood at 53% of the vote so far.
EYES ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
While the midterms were all about elections for the U.S. Congress, state governors, and other local offices, hovering over it all was the 2024 U.S. presidential race.
Trump, who still polls as the top choice among Republicans for the party's presidential nomination, nevertheless suffered a series of setbacks as far-right candidates he either recruited or became allied with performed poorly on Nov. 8. Some conservative Republican voters voiced fatigue with Trump.
At the same time, Ron DeSantis coasted to a second term as governor of Florida, defeating Democratic opponent Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points. Trump reportedly was seething over the high marks political pundits were doling out to DeSantis, seen as a potential challenger to Trump in the 2024 field of Republican presidential candidates.
The 2024 election will immediately influence many of the legislative decisions House Republicans pursue as they flex their muscles with a new-found majority, however narrow.
They have publicly talked about seeking cost savings in the Social Security and Medicare safety-net programs and making permanent 2017-enacted tax cuts that are due to expire.
Conservatives are threatening to hold back on a needed debt-limit increase next year unless significant spending reductions are achieved.
""It's critical that we're prepared to use the leverage we have,"" far-right House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry told Reuters last month.
First, the House must elect a speaker for the next two years. McCarthy on Tuesday won the support of a majority of his caucus to run for the powerful position to succeed Pelosi.
With such a narrow majority, McCarthy was working to get commitments from nearly every member of his unruly Republican members, having failed in just such an endeavor during a 2015 bid. Freedom Caucus members, about four dozen in all, could hold the keys to his winning the speakership and the viability of his speakership writ large.
