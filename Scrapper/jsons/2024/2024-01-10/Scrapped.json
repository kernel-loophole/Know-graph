Ex-MPA Mehdi accused the rival PML-Q leadership of looting and plundering development funds through receiving kickbacks and switching loyalties to avoid corruption cases. \nGujrat PML-N president Tahirul Mulk claimed that the PML-N candidates would sweep the elections in the whole district. \nThe speakers vowed to strive for the victory of the Nawabzada group\u2019s candidates in NA-63 and both provincial assembly seats.\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2024\n", "13": "LAHORE: The Factory Area police arrested a serving police inspector of the Counter-Terrorism Department and his father in connection with the murder case of his stepmother.\nThe police registered a case and handed them over to the investigation police for further action.\nAccording to the FIR, the police intervened when Tabasum Bibi was set on fire, and she later succumbed to deep burn injuries.\nTabasum\u2019s brother informed the police that she was allegedly murdered by her husband, Raja Nazir, and her stepson, CTD inspector Raja Humayun. \nHe alleged that both suspects used to torture his sister over petty domestic matters, and on the day of the incident, they set her on fire, leading to her death.\nThe Factory Area police took both suspects into custody and lodged an FIR against them.\nFactory Area SHO Wajihul Hassan said the body was shifted to the city morgue for postmortem.\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2024\n", "14": "TOBA TEK SINGH: The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) is being established to counter the increasing incidents of cybercrimes, and stringent measures are being implemented to control smuggling.\nThis was stated by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Rai Ijaz Ahmad, who addressed the business community at the FCCI, says a press release.\nHe advised FCCI members to transition to transparent transactions through government channels instead of making payments through \u201chawala hundi\u201d.  \nHe said while 50 per cent of remittances through hawala hundi dealers are related to genuine businessmen, the FIA prefers to overlook unintentional irregularities on a \u201cMens Rea\u201d basis.\n\u201cOur focus should be on dismantling the network of such dealers,\u201d he said, quoting the Financial Action Task Force and mentioning that Pakistan was placed in the grey list due to alleged money laundering.  \nMr Ahmad said the FIA, in close collaboration with state organisations and businesspeople, has been working to remove Pakistan from the grey list, and a separate dedicated anti-money laundering circle has been created to address the issue.\nHe said the Financial Management Unit in the State Bank of Pakistan is monitoring available financial data, \u201cred-flagging\u201d dubious, irregular, and disproportionate transactions. A team of senior officers examines these cases and sends suspicious transactions to the relevant departments or agencies for further investigation.\nBusinessmen were urged to exercise caution and refrain from engaging in illegal practices, as the monitoring system is set to become more stringent in the coming days. He explained the jurisdiction of FIA and other departments, noting that tax matters generally fall under the ambit of the FBR. However, any forgery or fraudulent transaction invokes the involvement of FIA.  \nHe emphasised that businessmen should make payments directly to the parties instead of using irrelevant accounts.\nSuspicion, he noted, may arise if a textile owner makes an out-of-proportion payment to a cement or steel bar unit. Investigations would become apparent if a transaction of billions of rupees is made through the bank account of a low-paid salaried person. Mr Ahmad said that fake invoices, seemingly aimed at saving 2-3% income tax, often extend to rebates of 17-18pc, with the involvement of FBR officials and bank staff in many cases.\nHe said that government agencies aim not to harass genuine businessmen, but conscious efforts should be made to eliminate Hawala Hundi and Benami accounts.  \nAhmad suggested that FCCI should organise an awareness session on this subject to sensitize and educate its members about the potential involvement in illegal practices, whether intentional or unintentional.\nRegarding ponzi housing schemes, he said it falls under NAB and Anti-Corruption Establishment, but the FIA may intervene if electricity is provided to such schemes without NOCs. He said the prevalence of the informal economy in Pakistan but emphasized the need to shift towards the documented economy. Strict measures, he warned, would be taken to curb smuggling, and businessmen were advised to avoid engaging in this illegal practice.\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2024\n", "15": "BAHAWALPUR: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Shaukat Basra tendered an apology to the Lahore High Court (LHC) Bahawalpur Bench judge for his baseless claim on social media about acceptance of his election petitions against the rejection of his nomination papers from a Haroonabad constituency.\nAccording to an official handout, Shaukat Basra appeared in the court of Mr Justice Sultan Tanveer Ahmed of LHC Bahawalpur Bench Election Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday.\nIn his confessional statement in the court, Basra submitted that learned judge\u2019s court had not passed any order on his election appeal.\nHe sought an unconditional apology, saying that his social media post regarding acceptance of his petition was based on misunderstanding and was contrary to the facts.\nBasra added that on issuing such unsuitable remarks on social media, he was submitting his whole-heatedly apology.\nJustice Sultan Tanveer Ahmed said that it was enough that Shaukat Basra has realised his mistake.\nShaukat Basra, in a social media post, had claimed that the learned court had passed orders on his election petitions, accepting the plea.\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2024\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804542/matric-students-in-punjab-to-appear-in-eight-papers-instead-of-nine-from-2025", "1": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804541/plea-against-ecp-ban-on-pre-poll-surveys-disposed-of", "2": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804540/interest-free-electric-bikes-rickshaws", "3": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804539/dars-brother-in-police-custody-govt-admits", "4": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804538/3-cops-held-for-harassing-looting-family-outside-hotel-in-lahore", "5": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804537/work-in-progress-to-rectify-six-choke-points-on-city-roads", "6": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804536/ppp-leaders-optimistic-about-bilawals-chances-from-lahore", "7": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804535/canal-desiltation-campaign-inaugurated", "8": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804534/pca-expanding-to-18-more-dists-launching-new-programmes", "9": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804533/non-bailable-arrest-warrants-for-moonis", "10": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804532/five-killed-17-injured-in-fog-related-accidents", "11": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804531/two-die-as-car-plunges-into-link-canal-near-ahmedpur-chattha", "12": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804530/nawabzada-group-launches-poll-campaign-with-farmhouse-event", "13": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804529/cop-father-held-in-murder-case", "14": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804528/new-agency-to-combat-rising-cyber-crimes", "15": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1804527/basra-tenders-apology-in-court-over-his-false-social-media-post"}, "Category": {"0": "lahore", "1": "lahore", "2": "lahore", "3": "lahore", "4": "lahore", "5": "lahore", "6": "lahore", "7": "lahore", "8": "lahore", "9": "lahore", "10": "lahore", "11": "lahore", "12": "lahore", "13": "lahore", "14": "lahore", "15": "lahore"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2024-01-10", "1": "2024-01-10", "2": "2024-01-10", "3": "2024-01-10", "4": "2024-01-10", "5": "2024-01-10", "6": "2024-01-10", "7": "2024-01-10", "8": "2024-01-10", "9": "2024-01-10", "10": "2024-01-10", "11": "2024-01-10", "12": "2024-01-10", "13": "2024-01-10", "14": "2024-01-10", "15": "2024-01-10"}}
