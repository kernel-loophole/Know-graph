The final notice was then issued, after which the halls were subsequently demolished.\nAccording to reports, the SBCA staff, along with heavy machinery and a contingent of anti-encroachment force, local police, and rangers, reached the spot and took action against 14 marriage halls established from Water Pump Chowrangi to Cafe Piala in the Gulberg on Thursday night.\nAccording to DC Central Taha Saleem, the action was taken on the orders of the Supreme Court, and it is aimed at addressing the issue of illegal marriage halls. Six months ago, notices were issued to the marriage halls\u2019 owners, but they failed to comply despite receiving notices. The flow of traffic was also adversely affected due to these illegal marriage halls, and waste from wedding halls was being dumped into the sewage system, causing damage to the sewage system of the area. \nThe operation was carried out by SBCA and anti-encroachment staff, while heavy machinery was used in the operation. However, initially, the personnel had to wait until late night as there were wedding ceremonies going on in some of the halls. \nMeanwhile, the area residents have expressed their relief, saying that the government should have taken this step 15 to 20 years ago. They said that the noise pollution from the wedding halls, including the bursting of firecrackers and gunfire, was causing significant problems for them and their children. The parking of cars by wedding guests in the streets was also causing significant inconvenience to the residents.\nMoreover, residents of the area also demanded that coaching centres, schools, CNG filling stations, shops, marketing, and other commercial activities running on the street where marriage halls were established should be abolished in the same way. \nWaiters working in the marriage halls expressed their concern, stating that they had become unemployed due to the collapse of the marriage halls. They demanded of the government to provide them jobs.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, May 13th, 2023.\n", "4": "Police claimed to have apprehended a suspect they said was member of a gang suspected of robbing a significant amount of money from a Turkish engineer in the jurisdiction of Saddar police station. \nTeken Matan was robbed by suspects in police uniforms on Abdullah Haroon Road on April 16.\nPolice managed to recover a vehicle and a police uniform during the operation; however, one of the gang's accomplices evaded capture and remains at large.\nIncidently, the apparently forged number plate of the white sedan is BAD 164, while Pakistan Penal Code 164 stands for abetment in illegal gratification by a government official.\nAccording to DIG South Irfan Baloch, the police had been closely monitoring the criminal group. Four policemen on two motorcycles were stationed at Daudpota Road in Saddar when they noticed two individuals behaving suspiciously in a car on Wednesday. The police officers attempted to stop the suspects, but they attempted to flee. A hot pursuit ensued, and the police fired at their vehicle\u2019s tyres near Lines Area Parking Plaza, which led to the arrest of one of the suspects, Shahid, son of Ali Ahmed Kufar. Unfortunately, the other suspect managed to escape.\nThe arrested individual and his accomplice were responsible for the robbery on April 16. They forcefully took a bag of money from the Turkish engineer, Teken Matan, at Abdullah Haroon Road. The incident occurred while the engineer parked his car and walked towards a money changer. The assailants, dressed in police uniforms, assaulted him and fled with the money bag. A case has been filed at Preedi police station concerning the incident.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, May 13th, 2023.\n", "5": "In a controversial move, several top officers of Sehwan Development Authority (SDA), including Planning and Development Control Director and Land Management Deputy Director, were relieved of their duties without any specified reasons. \nThe notification stated that any official activity conducted by these officers from May 11 will be considered illicit and treated as null and void. The Director General of the SDA, Saeed Sualeh Jumani, who himself is facing controversies related to his pay scale and dual charges, assigned two officers to immediately get the office rooms vacated from the ten officers and take into custody all the official records, stamps, registers, ledgers, and official vehicles. Non-compliance will result in stern action, warned Jumani.\nAn official from the SDA, who requested anonymity, suggested that the reason for the removal of these officers might be related to their refusal to comply with Jumani's whims. It is alleged that Jumani, a BS-19 officer who has been given two BS-20 charges, acts as a full-fledged head of the SDA, despite only having been given the look-after charge.\nThe SDA's jurisdiction extends to near Karachi, and a number of housing schemes are being launched by Karachi-based builders and developers within the authority's jurisdiction. However, the Sindh government has failed to appoint a full-time DG in the SDA, and the Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA) is also being headed by an acting DG who is actually the deputy commissioner of Hyderabad.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, May 13th, 2023.\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2416497/cattle-pens-set-up-on-govt-land", "1": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2416500/scs-relief-to-imran-irks-sindh-govt", "2": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2416503/pti-workers-sent-on-judicial-remand", "3": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2416506/wedding-halls-built-on-residential-plots-razed", "4": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2416509/police-arrest-suspect-involved-in-robbing-turkish-engineer", "5": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2416512/sehwan-development-authority-dg-removes-several-top-officers"}, "Category": {"0": "karachi", "1": "karachi", "2": "karachi", "3": "karachi", "4": "karachi", "5": "karachi"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2023-05-13", "1": "2023-05-13", "2": "2023-05-13", "3": "2023-05-13", "4": "2023-05-13", "5": "2023-05-13"}, "Pic_url": {"0": null, "1": null, "2": null, "3": null, "4": null, "5": null}}
