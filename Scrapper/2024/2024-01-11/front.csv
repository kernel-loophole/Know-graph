0,Fazl pledges to revive govt-TTP talks,JUI-F chief meets Afghanistan’s supreme leader,"JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday met with Afghanistan’s supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada in Kabul wherein it was assured that the next elections in Pakistan would be held peacefully and efforts would be made for the resumption of Islamabad’s talks with the banned outfit Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The Afghan government also demanded that Islamabad would have to play its role in the elimination of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) as well as chalk out a visa-free policy on the Chaman border alongside a soft plan on the expulsion of its refugees.
Kandahar Governor Mullah Shirin Akhund had promised a meeting of Haibatullah with the JUI-F chief on his visit to Kabul, but declined a huddle with other delegates.
Fazl and Haibatullah discussed the TTP, ISKP, border management, soft visa policy, and refugees during their one-on-one meeting.
The JUI-F chief promised that he would take up the issues of Kabul with the relevant quarters in Islamabad, but pressed the sureties of a ceasefire till peaceful elections in Pakistan, a source said.
The meeting was scheduled by former Kandahar governor Haji Yousuf Wafa. He is currently the governor of the Balkh province.
The source confirmed that Fazl took flight to Kandahar later in the day accompanied by Mullah Idrees and met with some members of the former Quetta Shura.
The overall visit of Fazl will bring a positive impact on the tense relationship between the two neighbouring countries. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been simmering for months over Kabul’s failure to stop the TTP-sponsored attacks from across the border.
Soon a short-term ceasefire with the TTP will be announced or there will be an unannounced one between the two sides.
Sources from the delegation also confirmed that a meeting of Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group is also on the agenda.
It has also been learnt that a day might also be added to the unannounced period of the JUI-F chief’s visit to Afghanistan.
Many Afghan Taliban members including those who are in the government have studied from seminaries run by the JUI-F. Observers believe that Pakistan may use the influence of the JUI-F chief to sort out the issue of the TTP.
An 11-member delegation, headed by the JUI-F chief, and including former South Waziristan MNA Maulana Jamaluddin Mehsud, Mufti Ibrar and members from the Haqqani religious seminary, are in Afghanistan since January 7.
Despite repeated attempts, the JUI-F spokesperson, who otherwise had been giving regular updates about Fazl’s engagements in Afghanistan, could not be reached.
The Afghan Taliban chief rarely meets leaders from outside. This was the only second known meeting he held with any foreign leader following his interaction with the Qatari Prime Minister last year.
The meeting could be a turning point in the bilateral ties between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban government. The two governments are at loggerheads over the issue of banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Sources familiar with the development said Maulana Fazl was given a brief and talking points about Pakistan’s stance before he traveled to Afghanistan. The sources said Maulana Fazl was told to convey a clear message to the Taliban chief that Kabul had to choose between Pakistan and the TTP.
The JUI-F chief was also told to inform the Taliban chief that without resolution of the TTP problem bilateral relationship could not move forward.
The Afghan Taliban government has so far not given any indication to take on the TTP. In fact, Maulana Fazl was told during a meeting with the Afghan Interim Prime Minister that the TTP was an internal problem of Pakistan and that it should find a solution from within.
One source, who deals with the Afghan issue, said if this was an attitude of the Taliban government then there won’t be any breakthrough. The source said the Taliban government was well aware that the TTP and its leadership were in Afghanistan. They had the “sanctuaries” and this was also corroborated by the UN and other countries, according to sources.
The JUI-F chief wanted to travel to Kabul to congratulate the Afghan Taliban for their return to power in August 2021 but he could not due to various reasons.
The sources, nevertheless, claimed that the Afghan Taliban, earlier, were not keen to extend him the invitation. Since Pakistan virtually severed high-level contacts with the Kabul regime, the Afghan Taliban decided to invite Maulana Fazl to share its perspective on the TTP and other issues.
Officials are skeptical about any major breakthrough because of the close links between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The visit may lower the temperature between the two sides but the prospects of any major headway are slim, according to sources.
Pakistani policymakers would now be waiting for the JUI-F chief’s briefing on his return to know what exactly transpired in his meeting with the Taliban supreme leader.
Some observers see the meeting as a last ditch effort to sort out the issue of TTP.With additional input from Kamran Yousaf in Islamabad

1,Imran given ‘out’ as Nawaz ‘pads up’,Tribunal upholds RO's ruling citing Imran's disqualification under Article 63 (1)(h) of the Constitution,"In a dramatic prelude to the February 8 elections, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday hurdled past objections to his candidacy from NA-130 while incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan faced the sting of rejection on appeals against the dismissal of his nomination papers for two National Assembly seats.
The appellate election tribunals delivered what came as a “double-edged verdict”, granting a clean chit to the Sharif family, including Nawaz Sharif, while quashing appeals by the former premier Imran Khan, former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, along with his wife and son, Moonis Elahi, against the rejection of their nomination papers.
Two separate appellate tribunals upheld the ROs' decision to reject Imran nomination papers.
The PTI’s founding chairman faced the stumbling block – potentially ousted from the electoral battleground – just as the party celebrated the return of its cherished ‘Bat’ symbol.
Meanwhile, the election tribunals also gave the green light to PTI’s Dr Yasmeen Rashid from NA-130, Mian Mehmood ur Rasheed from PP-169 and various other contestants from distinct constituencies by overturning the Returning Officers' decisions that previously rejected their nomination papers.
The election tribunals, in dismissing appeals, affirmed the decision of the ROs to accept the nomination papers of Nawaz Sharif from NA-130, Shehbaz Sharif from NA-132, and Maryam Nawaz from NA-119.
The appellants had contested the ROs' acceptance of their nomination papers.
The tribunals upheld the decisions of the ROs, dismissing appeals lodged by PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan from NA-122, as well as the appeals of PTI's former chief minister Ch. Pervez Elahi, his wife Qaisara Elahi, and their son Moonis Elahi from NA-64, NA-69, PP-32, and PP-34.
The twelve-judge election tribunals of the Lahore High Court (LHC) presided over appeals filed by contestants challenging the acceptance or rejection of their nomination papers by the respective ROs. January 10 marked the final day for appeal hearings.
To address challenges against the election tribunals' decisions, the LHC had initially formed a larger bench comprising five members, including Justice Shujaat Ali Khan, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Faisal Zaman, and Justice Jawad Hassan.
However, Justice Faisal Zaman withdrew from the bench, and Justice Shujaat Ali Khan was on medical leave during this period.
Following this, LHC CJ Muhammad Ameer Bhatti established a larger three-member bench comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Shahd Bilal, and Justice Jawad Hassan.
 
Sharif family
An appellate tribunal on Monday had reserved its verdict on an appeal against the acceptance of Nawaz Sharif’s nomination papers from NA-130, Lahore.

Pakistan Awami Mahaz chief Ishtiaq Ahmad Chaudhry, a lawyer, filed the appeal under section 63 of the Election Act 2017.
The appellant argued that Nawaz could not contest an election due to lifetime disqualification held by the Supreme Court for a person disqualified under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
He said the former prime minister was disqualified by the apex court for not being ‘sadiq’ and ‘ameen’ under article 62(1)(f).
In the case of former prime minister and PML-N president, the appellant had challenged RO’s decision of accepting his nomination papers, alleging “he had been identified as the mastermind of alleged criminal attack on the supreme court on November 28, 1997”.
Similarly, the appellant had challenged RO’s decision to accept the nomination papers of PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz on the grounds that she is not ‘sadiq’ and ‘ameen’.
The petitioner objector contended that ROs’ decision to accept her nomination papers from NA-119 was illegal and unlawful.
He cited various TV talk shows where Maryam Nawaz, during a live news segment with anchorperson Sana Bucha, publicly stated that she ""doesn't have any property in London or even in Pakistan.""
However, in a separate statement to anchorperson Sohail Warraich, she declared that she ""owned assets worth about 100 crores."" In addition, in an interview with anchorperson Javed Ch, Maryam
Nawaz's brother asserted that she is the beneficiary of his property in London.
He stressed that Maryam Nawaz has faced convictions in different cases, including the Panama case. Despite her declaration in the nomination papers stating no ownership of property outside Pakistan, her brother had previously claimed that she is a beneficiary of property in London.
He further pointed out that in the 2023 nomination papers, Maryam Nawaz had listed four individuals (Muhammad Safdar, Meheru Nisa Safdar, Muhammad Junaid Safdar, and Mah Noor Safdar) as dependents in her affidavits. However, in 2024, she omitted mentioning her children in the affidavit.
Referring to Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, which disqualifies individuals not meeting the criteria of being sadiq and ameen from contesting the 2024 elections, he requested the admission of his appeal and the rejection of the nomination papers.
 
Imran Khan
Meanwhile, an appellate election tribunal dismissed PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan's appeal against the RO's decision to reject his nomination papers from NA-122.
The tribunal upheld the RO's ruling, which cited Imran's disqualification under Article 63 (1)(h) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, along with section 232 of the Election Act 2017, due to ""the candidate being convicted by a court of law.""
Furthermore, the RO considered another ground for rejection, stating that ""the proposer of the candidate is not a registered voter in constituency NA-122, as per section 60(1) of the Election Act 2017.""
As for the Pervez Elahi and Moonis Elahi, the concerned appellate election tribunal while announcing a reserved decision dismissed appeals of the PTI’s former chief minister and his son against the orders of ROs wherein their nomination papers were rejected from constituencies NA-64, NA-69 and PP-32 and PP-34.
