0,Pakistan warns of ‘consequences’ after Iranian incursion,Foreign Office condemns ‘violation of country’s sovereignty; Tehran claims targeting militant group in Panjgur,"An Iranian drone and missile strike on targets, which Tehran described as bases for the militant group Jaish al-Adl, in the Panjgur district of Balochistan killed two “innocent children” and wounded three girls, Iranian state media and Foreign Office in Islamabad said on Tuesday.
Pakistan condemned the attack, describing it an “unprovoked violation” of the Pakistani airspace, and warned Tehran of serious consequences. The Foreign Office said in a late-night statement that the violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty was completely unacceptable.
Two bases of Jaish al Adl in Pakistan were targeted by missiles on Tuesday, Iranian state media reported, a day after Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards missiles strikes hit an “Israeli spy centre” in Iraq and targeted Islamic State militants in Syria.
""These bases were hit and destroyed by missiles and drones,"" media reports in Tehran said. Iran's Nournews, affiliated with the country's top security body, said the attacked bases were located in the Balochistan province.
However, Pakistan contested Iran’s claims that the strikes destroyed “terrorist hideouts” and strongly protested with the neighbouring country. “This violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty is completely unacceptable and can have serious consequences,” the Foreign Office statement said.
Jaish-al-Adl is a militant group established in 2012 and had been operating from Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan province. Tehran alleges that the group also has hideouts across the border in Pakistan.
The group since its inception took responsibility of several attacks against Iran’s security forces.
In February 2019, the group killed 27 security personnel, prompting Iranian civil and military leadership to issue stern warnings to Pakistan.

However, Tuesday’s strike came as major surprise because Tehran opted for this option despite existence of channels of communication between the two countries.
Also, the strikes were launched the day Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar met with the Iranian foreign minister on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. The Iranian president’s point man for Afghanistan was also in Islamabad, recently.
Soon after the attack, Pakistan’s strong protest was lodged with the concerned senior official in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran, while Iran’s charge d’affaires was summoned by the foreign ministry.
“Additionally, the Iranian charge d’affaires has been called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey our strongest condemnation of this blatant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and that the responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran.” according to the Foreign Office statement.
“It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the Foreign Office said. “Such unilateral acts are not in conformity with good neighbourly relations and can seriously undermine bilateral trust and confidence.”
The statement reiterated that Pakistan had always said that terrorism was a common threat to all countries in the region that required coordinated action.

1,Shehbaz questions sincerity of Imran’s revolution,"Says if PTI founder had played for country’s progress, the state of affairs would have been different","Former prime minister and PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif has said that had the PTI used the bat to play an innings for the progress and prosperity of the country, today’s state of national affairs and the condition of the people of Pakistan would have been totally different.
In a recent interview with a private news channel, he highlighted the missed opportunities by the PTI government, emphasising that a different trajectory could have been set for the country's progress and prosperity.
He pointed out that the Election Commission had issued notices to the PTI in 2021 when it was in power, not the PML-N. Therefore, the consequences of the notice are solely legal, and the PTI has no one else to blame for this matter.
Discussing the serious cases leading to Imran Khan's incarceration, Shehbaz stated, ""Imran is behind bars as a result of serious cases like the May 9 treason and £190 million, which was deposited elsewhere instead of the national treasury. This is purely a matter of law rather than anything else.""
Highlighting the economic challenges, Shehbaz criticised the PTI government's decisions, citing a ruined economy marked by inflation reaching unprecedented levels.
He pointed out the damaged diplomatic ties and torn treaties with the IMF as further consequences of the PTI reign.
Shehbaz expressed optimism about the PML-N's performance in the upcoming elections, saying: ""Recent polls show the PML-N making significant gains, indicating that the party is peaking at the right time. All surveys suggest that Nawaz Sharif will lead the country.""
Speaking on the challenges faced by the common man, he said: ""The elite can seek the best treatment abroad, but today, the common man is petrified even thinking about the cost of medical treatment, medicines, education and employment.""
He recalled the times in 2013 when Nawaz provided free treatment, medicines, and education for the poor.
Addressing the ousting of Nawaz’s government, Shehbaz acknowledged that the then chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar's role but emphasised Nawaz’s response, stating: ""Nawaz Sharif is not just a politician; he is a statesman.""
Discussing the potential of Pakistan's youth, Shehbaz urged the younger generation to prioritise education, emphasising that the future lies in IT, and the youth are the country's biggest asset.
Concluding the interview, he reiterated the PML-N's commitment to public service, stating: ""Punjab is the largest province and the stronghold of the PML-N; the people of Punjab and Pakistan trust the PML-N to deliver because of our public service.""

Maryam vows to end inflation
PML-N Senior Vice President and Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz has vowed to end inflation and resume development work if her party is voted to power during the general elections on Feb 8.
While addressing the party workers at the beginning of the election campaign in the PP-159 constituency, Maryam said that the infiltrators occupied Lahore for the last five years and did not carry out a single development work, but the mark of service left by her party was there.
“On Feb 8, the infiltrators have to be thrown out of Lahore. The more seals are placed on the tiger, the faster the development work will be and inflation will end,” Maryam said.
Parvez Rasheed, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Rana Mubasher Iqbal and others were also present.
Maryam was warmly welcomed on her arrival in the constituency.
Maryam said that she would serve the people day and night if they made tiger victorious in the general elections.
“You can see that the metro bus is passing somewhere and the speedo bus is passing somewhere. You will see the signs of service of Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and the tiger.”
She said, “You made Rana Mubasher successful by voting for him repeatedly. He is the silent mujahid of Nawaz Sharif. He is standing in the constituency today because he has served you day and night for five years.”
The PML-N SVP said in five years, the wheel of development did not move forward, accusing the then chief justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar of stopping the Orange Line project for one-and-a-half years.
She said after the departure of PML-N, there was no development work here and Lahore became abandoned.
“There is no one to pick up the garbage here. These infiltrators have to be thrown out of Lahore on Feb 8, as they have only filled their pockets and did no work.”
The chief organiser said after Feb 8, the journey of development would resume from where it had stopped and the destiny of Punjab and Pakistan, including this constituency, would be changed.

2,Polls to hit snag if ‘symbols keep changing’,ECP says it has already ordered printing of ballot papers,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday threatened to postpone the next general elections in certain constituencies if the process of changing electoral symbols did not stop, saying that it could not keep making alterations, especially when the polls were just around the corner.
In a blunt statement, the ECP did not mince words to say that the elections would be postponed in the constituencies where the political parties or candidates had requested to change their electoral symbols as the commission had already ordered the printing of the ballot papers for the general polls scheduled to be held on Feb 8.
Although some political leaders, including PPP Co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari as well as JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, have casually called for delaying the elections and the Senate passed a resolution seeking the postponement of elections – because of security concerns and the harsh winter season, this is the first time the commission has bluntly said the process of changing of electoral symbols must be stopped now or the polls would be put off.
Apparently, the ECP’s statement has come in response to the requests made by political parties and candidates to change their electoral symbols as well as the applications pending before the higher courts.
Senator Taj Haider, the in-charge of the PPP’s central polls cell, recently wrote to the chief election commissioner (CEC), asking that the ECP should change the electoral symbols of at least seven of its candidates as they had not been allotted the ‘arrow’, pointing out that the returning officers declared them as independent ones.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Secretary General Nayyar Hussain Bukhari also raised the issue, saying the matter would be taken to courts.
In a statement, Bukhari said the PPP candidates, including Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan Dullah from NA-58 Chakwal, Hasan Sardar from NA-59 Chakwal, Chaudhry Atif Rafique from NA-122 Lahore, Chaudhry Naushad from PP-20 Chakwal, Raja Amjad Noon from PP-21 Chakwal, Mujahid Islam from PP-119 Toba Tek Singh and Muhammad Fayyaz from PP-163 Lahore, had entered the race on the party’s tickets but they had been allotted different symbols.
In response, the ECP officials refuted the PPP’s allegation that its candidates had been denied the party symbol and described the statement as prone to exaggeration.
The ECP officials maintained that the PPP was drumbeating over the issue as the candidates either sought the electoral symbol of another political party when they submitted nomination papers or left the column of their affiliation “blank”.

Similarly, PTI founding chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan’s plea against the rejection of his nomination papers is still pending with the Lahore High Court.
On Tuesday, the LHC reserved its verdict on Imran’s appeal challenging the decisions of the returning officers as well as the tribunals that have rejected his nomination papers from NA-122 Lahore and NA-89 Mianwali.
While leaving nothing to imagination about the possible delay in polls in different constituencies, the ECP noted that the electoral symbols were being changed from various forums after they were allotted to political parties and independent candidates.
In the statement, the ECP said it should be noted that after the allotment of the electoral symbols, the commission had ordered the printing of ballot papers to three printing corporations and they had already started their work.
“If the process of changing election symbols continues in this way then, on the one hand, there is a fear of delay in the election because the ballot paper will have to be reprinted, for which time is already limited,” the ECP statement read.
It continued that the special ballot papers would have to be reprinted. The statement added that those already printed would be lost.
Pointing out that 800 tons of paper was used for printing the ballot papers in the 2018 elections, the ECP said it was estimated that 2,070 tons would be used for this purpose in the 2024 polls.
Similarly, it explained that 11,700 candidates had participated in the 2018 elections, while this time, 18,059 were in the fray.
“In 2018, 220 million ballot papers were printed while this time 260 million ballot papers are being printed,” it elaborated.
The statement read that in this connection, the ECP was holding meetings on how to deal with the situation.
“The proposal is also being considered that if this process of changing election symbols does not stop, there will be no other option but to postpone the elections in such constituencies,” the statement concluded.
Separately, in a major reshuffle in the ECP, the resignation of its secretary Omar Hamid Khan has been accepted – with Dr Syed Asif Hussain replacing him – in addition to the transfers and postings of its other high-ups, including provincial commissioners.
The ECP issued separate notifications – one for accepting Hamid’s resignation and the other for Asif’s appointment.
According to the first notification, Hamid tendered his resignation because of ill health and it was approved by the CEC as per the rules of the ECP, effective immediately.
Hamid was appointed the ECP secretary on July 9, 2021 and held the post till his resignation on Jan 16, 2024.
The other notification read that the CEC had appointed Asif as the new secretary under Section 6(2) of the Elections Act, 2017 along with eight, nine and 10 of the Election Commission Rules 1989.
Asif is a retired officer of Grade-22 and was serving as the special secretary at the ECP Secretariat in Islamabad before his new assignment.
The notification added that the appointment would be effective immediately on a one-year contractual basis in public interest.
It should be noted that last week there were news stories of the ECP secretary’s resignation but the commission’s spokesperson claimed that Hamid was on leave after contracting Covid-19 and he would resume his duties as soon as his health permitted.
In another notification, the ECP informed that Balochistan Election Commissioner Aijaz Anwer Chohan has been appointed as the new Punjab election commissioner in place of Saeed Gul, who has been transferred to the post of director general (Elections' Cell & Head of Elections' Wing) at the commission’s secretariat in Islamabad.
Similarly, Punjab Election Commissioner Farid Afridi has been appointed the new Balochistan election commissioner.
