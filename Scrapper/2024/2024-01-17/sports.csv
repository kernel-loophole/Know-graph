The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) a conglomerate of parties formed to oust Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government could not sustain and they have pitted candidates against each other, which, according to political pundits would eventually benefit a single party.
Until a few weeks ago, the top leadership of PML-N was trying to woo MQM-P for an electoral alliance against Pakistan Peoples Party, the ruling party in Sindh, but the meetings failed to bear fruit.

Furthermore, seat adjustments are anticipated for the provincial seats PS-106 and PS-107 in the said constituency.
Lyari, a political hotbed, has PPP candidate Nabil Gabol, Tehreek Labaik Pakistan (TLP) candidate Sharjeel Gopalani, Jamaat-e-Islami's Fazlur Rehman Niazi, Central Muslim League candidate Hamza, and JDA candidate Shaista Ameer and others in the run. 
Abdul Shakoor Shad, who had defeated Bilawal Bhutto Zardari from Lyari on a PTI ticket in the 2018 general elections, was competing as an independent.
The candidates vying for the NA-229 Malir seat are MQM Pakistan's Fouzia Hameed, PML-N Qadir Bakhsh Kalmati, and ANP Sajid Mehmood. The candidates for the NA-230 Malir seat are Haji Muzafar Ali Shujra of the PML-N, Asif Ali of the ANP, and Muhammad Ali Shah of the JUI. This indicates that the PDM parties are running against one another in this constituency.

In NA-238, candidates from GDA, MQM-P, PML-N and ANP face off against one another. The PML-N, GDA, and MQM-P candidates are competing for the seat of NA-240 South as well. PML-N and GDA have issued tickets to their candidates for the competition with Farooq Sattar in NA-241.
