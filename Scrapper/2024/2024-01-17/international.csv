The crackdown, led by Deputy Director Asif Naseem, aimed to combat the menace of illegal migration.
Acting on confidential information, ASI Abdul Ghaffar, alongside the FIA Team Gwadar and FIA Composite Circle Gwadar, carried out targeted operations at various locations in Gwadar. These efforts were aimed at curbing the activities of human traffickers who exploit the Arabian Sea in Mekran for smuggling individuals to Gulf States.
The recent operations resulted in the apprehension of 13 individuals hailing from different districts of Punjab, four Afghan nationals, and one facilitator orchestrating illegal migration. The arrests adhered to established protocols, and the detained individuals are currently undergoing thorough investigations.

Asif Naseem emphasized the agency’s dedication to addressing the serious issue of human trafficking. He commended the proactive role of ASI Abdul Ghaffar and the entire FIA team in Gwadar for their commitment to upholding the law and ensuring the safety of individuals seeking a better life abroad.
The detained individuals, who attempted to travel to foreign countries illegally, are now subject to legal proceedings. The FIA remains steadfast in its efforts to uncover the networks behind such activities, focusing on dismantling human trafficking operations and protecting vulnerable individuals from falling prey to these criminal enterprises, according to a well-informed source within the agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to communicate with the media.
This latest crackdown sends a clear message to those involved in human trafficking, underscoring the FIA’s commitment to maintaining the security and integrity of the immigration process.

1,Boosted security for tense poll districts,"In militancy-plagued K-P districts, 11 personnel are to be deployed at most sensitive polling stations","The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has mobilized an additional 26,213 security personnel from various provincial departments in preparation for the upcoming general elections in the province. 
This announcement came during a crucial meeting held on Tuesday, chaired by Caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retd) Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, to assess the government’s readiness for the impending elections.
This surge in security personnel aims to fortify the electoral process and maintain order across the province during the upcoming polls. The move underscores the government’s commitment to fostering a secure and conducive environment for citizens to exercise their democratic rights.
During the meeting, it was underscored that the forthcoming general elections would mark a historic occasion, as both national and provincial assemblies’ elections are set to be conducted simultaneously in both the settled and merged districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. 
This synchronized approach is a noteworthy departure from previous election practices, signaling an alignment with contemporary democratic norms.
A total of 45 general seats in the National Assembly and 115 general seats in the Provincial Assembly will be contested in the upcoming elections. The electoral landscape will comprise 15,737 polling stations strategically distributed across the province.

Out of these, 4,812 have been categorized as the most sensitive, 6,581 as sensitive, and 4,344 as normal. Additionally, 1,919 polling stations are earmarked for the snow-bound areas of the province, taking into account the unique challenges posed by weather conditions.
The registered voter count for Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa stands at an impressive 21,692,381 individuals.
Security arrangements for the elections were outlined in detail during the meeting. The most sensitive polling stations, especially in the southern belt and merged districts, will be manned by 11 security personnel each. 
Similarly, seven security personnel will be deployed at most sensitive polling stations in the rest of the districts. For sensitive polling stations, seven security personnel will be assigned in the merged and southern districts, while five security personnel will cover similar stations in the rest of the districts. Normal polling stations will see the deployment of four security personnel in the merged and southern districts and four or five in the rest of the districts.
Despite the meticulous planning, the government faces a challenge in meeting the required number of security personnel. Presently, only 89,959 police personnel are available, creating a shortfall of 25,471. In an effort to bridge this gap, the Ministry of Interior has been approached to secure additional support, including four Wings of Frontier Corps and 165 Platoons of Frontier Constabulary.

3,Agriculture faces climate fallout,"Yield of fruits, vegetables and whole grains has undergone a sharp decline across several crop producing areas of K-P","Apart from their breathtaking landscape and picturesque sceneries, Pakistan’s northern areas are well known for producing some of the country’s finest variety of fruits and vegetables. In recent times however, the drastic changes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (K-P) weather conditions and rainfall rate have come as a bolt from the blue for its agriculturalists, who rely heavily on farming for sustaining their livelihoods.
Nawab Khan is one such farmer from the Utmanzai district of Charsadda, who has been harvesting sugarcane and strawberry crops since the past 13 years. This year however, a severe scarcity of water due to a lack of adequate rainfall significantly reduced his crop yield. “My strawberry crop yield had declined by almost 50 per cent in March last year while the sugarcane crop also faced a similar drop in yield from November onwards,” resented Khan, who further claimed that the number of people associated with farming in Charsadda had reduced to half given the changing weather conditions and declining profitability of the profession.
Similarly, Nisar Chacha, who has been cultivating carrots in the Utmanzai area for the past 10 years, also worried about the sudden changes in rainfall and weather conditions. “Over the past five years, water scarcity has caused the cost of producing carrots to increase by five to 10 times,” regretted Nisar, who disclosed that a similar quandary was plaguing the orange production zones in Manki Sharif, Pir Piai and Ziarat Kaka Sahib located in the Nowshera district of K-P.
Confirming Nisar’s speculation, Shafiq Khan, an orange farmer from Ziarat Kaka Sahib told the Express Tribune that the growing scantiness of rainfall had significantly impacted the quantity and quality of his produce. “Blood oranges require ample rainwater during the harvest period, in order to develop their natural juiciness and sweetness. Unfortunately, the lack of rainfall has not only reduced our yield by 30 per cent but has also ruined the distinctive zesty flavour of our oranges,” expressed Khan.

Apart from blood oranges, several districts like Kohat and Hingo are also fairly famous for producing a splendid variety of guavas. However, just like the other citrus fruits, these too have observed a downward trend in production.
“Premature rains and scarcity of rainfall have greatly shortened the guava production season in Kohat. Furthermore, the little guava that is produced tastes no way near what it used to taste like,” said Nimroz, a guava farmer, who also claimed that wheat production in Lower Chitral had also been hampered.
“In case there is no rainfall in the upcoming few days, there is a high risk of the wheat drying up, which will cause immense trouble to the local people,” warned Saud, a farmer from Drosh in Chitral.
According to Dr Farida Anjum, a researcher working as an agriculture officer for the Department of Agriculture K-P, extreme heat during summers, and changing weather conditions during winters had definitely posed a new challenge to the agriculture sector “Such challenges can be better tackled through measures taken at the local, regional and national levels,” she opined.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the impact of climate change on crop production and quality in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dr Attaur Rahman, an agronomist and climatologist said, “Usually, cold winds enter Pakistan from the Central Asian countries through Afghanistan during winters, triggering a spell of seasonal rainfall. This year, however, we only had the smog season and very little rainfall was recorded. All relevant departments are working together towards tackling climate change in the province, but due to a lack of coordination, the problem remains unresolved.”
