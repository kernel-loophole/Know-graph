• Team constituted under Peca includes officials from police, FIA, PTA and intelligence agencies
• PBC, SCBA back chief justice, decry undue criticism
• PTI slams lawyer bodies’ presser, insists Jan 13 judgement was ‘flawed’
ISLAMABAD: The car­e­taker government on Tue­s­day formed a five-member joint investigation team (JIT) to “ascertain facts behind a malicious social media campaign” against Supreme Court judges.
Meanwhile, the country’s premier legal bodies came to the aid of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and the Supreme Court against the backdrop of a “smear campaign” that erupted on social media soon after the Jan 13 judgement.
The JIT — formed under Section 30 (power to investigate) of the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016 — will be convened by the additional director general of the Federal Investiga­tion Agency’s (FIA) cybercrime wing, according to an interior ministry notification, seen by Dawn.
It also comprises representatives of the Intelli­gence Bureau, Inter-Serv­ices Intelli­ge­nce, the Pak­is­tan Telecom­m­u­nication Authority (PTA), and the deputy inspector general of Islamabad police. The team can co-opt any other member if required.
The notification, signed by FIA Deputy Secretary Muhammad Ziaul Haq, said the JIT’s terms of reference would be to “ascertain facts behind malicious social media campaign attempting to malign the image of the honourable judges of the Supreme Court”.
The committee will also identify and bring culprits to book in accordance with relevant laws, present challans in relevant courts and recommend measures to prevent such incidents in future.
“The JIT shall submit a preliminary report to the Ministry of Interior within a fortnight,” the notification said, adding that the FIA headquarters would provide support to the panel during the investigation.
The authorities did not identify any social media posts they deem part of the campaign.
 
 

After marathon hearings last week, a three-member Supreme Court bench headed by CJP Isa on Jan 13 upheld the Election Commission’s decision to revoke the PTI’s iconic electoral symbol, the cricket bat, and declare its intra-party polls “unconstitutional”.
PBC, SCBA back Justice Isa
Meanwhile, in a media interaction at the Supreme Court building in Islam­abad, officials of the Pak­is­tan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) backed CJP Isa amid renewed criticism following the Jan 13 judgement. They stressed that everybody had the right to criticise any judgement, but they would not tolerate the criticism of judges and the apex court using foul language.
The representatives who spoke on the occasion included PBC Vice Chair­man Haroonur Rashid; the chairman of its executive committee, Hassan Raza Pasha; senior member Qalbe Hassan; and SCBA President Shahzad Shaukat.
Mr Rashid asked senior lawyers not to use contemptuous remarks against judges and to exercise caution in their commentary on judgements while maintaining their respect.
 
 

Mr Shaukat lamented the tendency to initiate disparaging campaigns against judges and the courts. He insisted that passing fair comments on any judgement was acceptable, but mere criticism to bring the judiciary into disrepute should not be tolerated.
He said the SCBA had monitored all programmes on different TV channels after the Jan 13 judgement and concluded that no one could find holes in the verdict, but everyone was merely criticising the denial of the election symbol.
Referring to arguments that the top court could have given the benefit to the mainstream political party under Article 17 of the Constitution, a provision that talks about people’s right to form a political party, Mr Shaukat explained that constitutional rights were subject to and subservient to laws.
 


He said the lawyer bodies would take all possible measures to block with force the trend of unleashing a disparaging campaign against the judiciary.
Mr Pasha said both PBC and SCBA were on the same page in disseminating a clear message that the two bodies would not tolerate attempts to belittle the respect and prestige of the top judiciary and their adjudicators.
Qalbe Hassan of the PBC called for a representative convention of office-bearers of all the bar councils and associations of the country to take a joint stand against the tendency to malign the judiciary and the judges on social media after an unfavourable verdict.
This, he said, was essential to save democracy, which couldn’t survive if the highest judicial institutions like the Supreme Court were targeted with impunity in such a regrettable manner.
The officials also asked the PTA and the FIA that instead of becoming silent spectators, they should swiftly move by tracing social media accounts that generate such campaigns.
At the same time, the court should also initiate contempt of court proceedings against those found guilty of launching smear campaigns against judges, they said.
PTI flays ‘political presser’
Meanwhile, the PTI vehemently rejected the PBC and SCBA’s “political press conference”, saying it was part of the same scheme under which the door of free and fair elections had been closed by the Supreme Court upon 125 million voters of the country.
 
 

In a statement, a PTI spokesperson said the SC decision to strip the party of its electoral symbol was absolutely flawed and offensive and allegedly opened the door to a distortion in the constitutional and democratic scheme of the country.
He claimed that of the 175 political parties in the country, the PTI conducted the most effective and transparent intra-party elections. He said the party conducted two intra-party polls — on June 8, 2022, and Dec 2, 2023 — on which the ECP could not raise any reasonable and legal objections.

1,"Torkham, Kharlaachi may be shut for good, warns Kabul","New visa restrictions not acceptable to Afghan Taliban, Pakistani officials told.","KHYBER: Amid extensive deliberations between government officials and traders on Tuesday to find an amicable solution to visa restrictions imposed on Afghan transporters, the Afghan Taliban authorities threatened to permanently close down the Torkham and Kharlaachi borders with Pakistan if a mutually agreeable solution was not found to the lingering issue.
Sources at Torkham told Dawn on Tuesday on condition of anonymity that the flag meeting between Pakistani and Afghan border security officials, held on Monday evening, ended on a sour note, with the Afghan Taliban refusing to continue the dialogue process if their Pakistani counterparts did not come up with a mutually agreeable solution to the visa policy issue for Afghan transporters.
They said that Afghan authorities had flatly conveyed to Pakistani security officials that the new restrictions were not acceptable to them as they were not given any prior formal intimation of the implementation  of the visa policy.
 
 

It was also learnt that Afghan authorities had demanded their Pakistani counterparts allow all Afghan transporters stranded on Pakistani soil to go back to their country, after which they would close the border permanently by erecting a concrete wall at the main gate.

New visa restrictions not acceptable to Afghan Taliban, Pakistani officials told

Border closure
Meanwhile, the Torkham border crossing remained closed for all types of trading activities for a fourth consecutive day on Tue­s­day, with some of the fruit-laden vehicles opting to return to Pesha­war for fear of their merchandise rotting due to a prolonged delay in the opening of the border.
Earlier in the day, a delegation of local traders and members of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industries (SCCI) held a meeting with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa caretaker chief minister retired Justice Arshad Hussain and conveyed to him the fallout of the sudden imposition of visa restrictions.
Zahidullah Shinwari, a former SCCI president, told Dawn that the delegation suggested the caretaker CM to defer the implementation of the new visa policy for at least two months to enable the maximum number of Afghan transporters to complete the process of acquiring valid travel documentation.
He said the chief minister was not only informed about the financial losses local transporters and traders had suffered due to the closure of the border, but also that Pakistan was in serious danger of permanently losing the Afghan market for its various export merchandise.
Mr Shinwari said the chief minister assured the team of his ‘who­l­e­hearted’ support in conveying their grievances to the federal government, but at the same time expre­s­sed his inability to make any cha­nges in the visa policy on his own, as it was not a provincial subject.
Also on Tuesday, another meeting was held between senior customs and security officials which discussed in detail the current situation both at Torkham and Kharlaachi border.
Customs officials had been ins­i­s­ting that the requirement for legal travel documents was imp­lemented the world over, with Pakistan and Afghanistan being no exception.
They said the Afghan authorities were conveyed about the imposition of the visa policy several times, but Kabul had failed to take any practical steps to adhere to international border crossing rules.
The immigration official at Torkham also said the new policy would help them keep track of all the people frequently traveling on both sides of the border.

2,Iran ‘attacks militant bases in Panjgur’,"Strike killed two children and injured three girls, Foreign Office says.","QUETTA: Iran laun­ched attacks in Pakistan on Tuesday targeting what it described as bases for the militant group Jaish al-Adl in the border town of Panjgur in Balochistan, the Iranian state media reported, prompting strong condemnation from Islamabad.
“Two key strongholds of the Jaysh al-Dhulm (Jaish al-Adl) terrorist group in Pakistan” were “specifically targeted and successfully demolished by a combination of missile and drone attacks”, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency said.
 






Jaish al-Adl has previously mounted attacks on Iranian security forces in the border area with Pakistan. Tuesday’s attack in Balochistan came a day after Iran’s elite Revo­lutionary Guards attacked targets in Iraq and Syria with missiles.
Pakistan strongly condemned the unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that the strike inside Pakistani territory killed two children and injured three girls.
“This violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty is completely unacceptable and can have serious consequences,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday night. The statement didn’t mention the location of the attacks.
Tasnim reported that the “focal point of this operation was the region known as Kouh-Sabz (green mountain)” in Balochistan.
Local authorities said they had also received information about such an attack, but had no further details at the time of going to print. Reports from the area suggested that a missile hit a mosque, partially damaging it and injuring some people.
In its statement, the foreign office described the incident as an “illegal act”.
It said a strong protest had been lodged with Tehran, while the Iranian charge d’affaires had been called to MoFA to convey “strongest condemnation of this blatant violation”.

3,"Situationer: No end in sight for PTI’s ‘tribulations’, even after polls","Party members will become ""independent"" lawmakers, defection clause will not apply to them.","There seems to be no end in sight for the sufferings of the Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) as the party, after a likely bumpy ride in the Feb 8 elections, will have to face a tough time in keeping its elected ‘independent’ members in line and under control throughout the tenure of the next National Assembly.
Erstwhile PTI Chairman Barris­ter Gohar Ali Khan had already hinted at the possible difficulties the party might face after the elections when he expressed the fear that the court’s decision could incr­ease the likelihood of “horse-trading”.
He had made the statement while talking to reporters after the Supreme Court upheld a decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) revoking PTI’s ‘bat’ symbol.
 
 

PTI candidates will now contest the elections as independents with different electoral symbols. The decision has also deprived the PTI of its right to nominate its members on reserved seats for women and minorities.
Mr Khan’s fear seems to be justified, as in the past, the country has witnessed independent lawmakers making bargains many-a time on the occasion of elections for the prime minister and chief ministers, as well as speakers and deputy speakers of the assemblies. Besides,  independents have also resorted to ‘blackmail tactics’ at the time of voting on many crucial bills to get their way.

Party members will become ‘independent’ lawmakers, defection clause will not apply to them

In an interview with Geo News, Barrister Gohar reportedly expre­ssed the hope that independent candidates affiliated with the PTI would remain loyal to it, stating that the party also had a ‘Plan C’ for regaining its lost reserved seats.
He then explained that if independent candidates affiliated with the PTI joined the party again after it reformed itself, then the party would regain its reserved seats.
 
 

PTI’s Information Secr­e­­tary Rauf Hassan, when contacted, said the party had prepared a plan to keep its elected members within the party discipline. He, however, refused to disclose the plan.
A source in the PTI later claimed that the party leadership had decided to obtain affidavits from the elected members that they would not defect to the party at any stage and would continue to vote in the assemblies in line with the party leadership’s decision.
He added the party had given tickets only to the loyal members after thorough scrutiny in the wake of the defections it had already faced after the May 9 incident.
Defection clause
Parliamentary and political experts also believe that the PTI may not be able to control its members in the upcoming assemblies as the defection clause, Article 63-A, will not apply to them.
 
 

They say that these members, even if remain loyal to their party and do not join any other party within three days of their notification of victory, will be considered as independents throughout the five-year tenure of the assemblies.
According to Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Trans­parency (Pildat) president Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, the Election Rules 2017 are quite explicit in this respect. For independent legislators joining a political party to give that party the advantage of claiming proportionate reserved seats, he said, Rule 94 defined the political party as the one which had been allotted a symbol.
“If the party has obtained a symbol by then and the party has nomination papers filed for reserved seats, a case may be made for claiming its share of reserved seats. However, one may interpret that to qualify for reserved seats, a party should contest the general elections on a common symbol,” he said, adding that he believed that the matter would ultimately revert to the Supreme Court for conclusive adjudication.
According to Mr Mehboob, independent members can join any party at any time during their term or form a new party but in order to be counted for giving weightage to a parliamentary party, they must join the party within three days of final notification of their membership.
 
 

Similarly, former ECP secretary and Punjab Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Kanwar Dilshad, when contacted, said the PTI could go for fresh intra-party elections and satisfy the ECP after the general polls, but the PTI-backed candidates would not be able to join the party.
He said the law prescribed time for independents to join a party, and if they didn’t, they would remain independents thro­u­­ghout their five-year term.
“So there is no way, the PTI can make up for the loss of reserved seats”, he said, adding the independently elected lawmakers can form groups in respective houses with whichever name.
Rule 92(6) of the Election Rules 2017 provides for independents to join a party within three days if they want to be counted in calculation for the share of reserved seats for each party.
It states: “The expression ‘total number of general seats won by political party’ shall include the independent returned candidate or candidates who may duly join such political party within three days of the publication in the official gazette of the names of the returned candidates.”
It further says that “the consent of the independent candidate so delivered to the Commission shall, in no circumstances, be open to recall or cancellation.”
According to Mr Mehboob, once independents join a party, the defection clause will apply to them as it would apply to any other member. He said once they joined a party within three days, they became a member of that party and the defection clause leading to their de-seating would be applicable.
When asked about the possibility of forming a separate group in the assembly by these independents after winning the elections, he said that since the new group would not have contested the election under a common symbol, they wouldn’t be able to claim reserved seats as well as a share in the standing committees.
The Pildat chief said in the prevailing conditions, independent legislators might fall prey to horse trading unless the party commanded moral control over its affiliates.
He said the PML-N also faced such a situation in the Senate when quite a few of its senators were made ‘independent’ by a very “unfair SC judgement but I don’t think any senator defected”.

4,"PTI to spring surprise on Feb 8, claims Imran","Ex-PM says his party being condemned for May 9 riots without ""solid proof""; LHC reserves decision on nomination papers.","ISLAMABAD: In spite of a protracted crackdown on his political party, former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday appeared buoyant about its electoral prospects, saying the PTI will spring a ‘surprise’ on Feb 8 through its ‘Plan C’, which is ready after the failure of its so-called ‘Plan A’ and ‘Plan B’.
The PTI founder made these remarks during a conversation with reporters at Adiala Jail, who had gathered to cover the proceedings of cases, including the cipher case, underway against him in prison.
Mr Khan did not elaborate on what he meant by Plan C, but a day earlier, former PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan had said that the said plan revolved around retaining the reserved seats of the party following the loss of their electoral symbol, ‘bat’.
 
 

‘Plan B’ was ostensibly a deal the PTI had signed with its splinter group, ‘PTI-Nazriati’, to contest polls under the ‘batsman’ symbol, which was thwarted by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

Ex-PM says his party being condemned for May 9 riots without ‘solid proof’; LHC reserves decision on his nomination papers

On Tuesday, the PTI founder said that the party leadership knew that conspirators would spoil their plans, therefore, they had worked out alternative strategies.
He claimed that a conspiracy was hatched against the PTI government, adding that about 10,000 workers of the party were put behind bars and efforts to dismantle the political party were also in full swing. He said that as the founder of the PTI, whose political struggle spanned over 27 years, he was facing multiple charges along with his spouse Bushra Bibi.
Cipher issue
He also talked about the cipher issue, saying former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa offered him a two-thirds majority to keep quiet on the cipher issue and warned him of consequences if he tried to highlight the issue in public.
He said that Gen Bajwa had made the offer during meetings held at the President’s House, provided he  (Imran) would “behave sensibly and would not underscore the cipher issue”.
PTI’s founding chairman said that his party was being targeted over violence on May 9. He further alleged that the violent protests targeting the Corps Commander House and the GHQ were a part of the ‘London agreement’ and claimed that the PTI was not behind this mess.
Mr Khan denied a news report that he hurled threats to the members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and warned them of proceedings for high treason.
Nomination papers
Separately, a Lahore High Court full bench on Tuesday reserved its verdict on two petitions of Imran Khan, challenging the decisions of the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-122, Lahore and NA-89, Mianwali.
 
 

Mr Khan’s nomination papers were rejected primarily on the grounds of being convicted in the Toshakhana case. His nomination papers from NA-122 were also dismissed on the grounds of the proposer not being a voter from the constituency.
Advocate Uzair Bhandari argued on behalf of Mr Khan that the conviction on the charge of moral turpitude did not fall under the definition of disqualification. He said the conviction of the petitioner could not be equated with the conviction for corruption or accumulating illegal assets.
He pointed out that an Indian court enlisted the offence of moral turpitude lower than the offence involving financial corruption. However, the bench observed that the standards of morality in Pakistan were different from other regions.
He argued that the returning officer (RO) had no jurisdiction to pass the impugned order on the basis of the conviction on moral turpitude. He stated that the Islamabad High Court had already suspended the sentence of the petitioner. A lawyer for the ECP argued that the conviction of the petitioner was still in force and he had not been acquitted by the high court.
Toshakhana case
Meanwhile, senior counsel Sardar Latif Khosa on Tuesday requested for an early hearing of an appeal seeking to set aside Aug 5, 2023, his three-year conviction awarded by the trial court to PTI founder Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case.
Senior counsel Sardar Shahbaz Khosa had made a verbal request before a three-member bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, which was hearing a different case.
At this, the CJP regretted that on the one hand, the counsel was seeking relief from the court but on the other, he did not pose confidence in the courts and hurled allegations outside the court.
The CJP suggested to the counsel to move an application for the early hearing of the case and the court would grant any relief if the law necessitated it.
