0,SIFC steps in to end differences over gas price hike,"Asks PBS to reconcile data, report actual price situation in next meeting","The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has intervened to resolve a dispute over the actual increase in gas prices, as the national statistics agency has reported a staggering 1,100% increase, which is 10 times more than the interim government’s claim.
The dispute landed in the SIFC after the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) and the Ministry of Energy gave varying figures two months ago.
Officials said that the SIFC in its last meeting asked both the PBS and the Ministry of Energy to end the row within two weeks, a deadline that is ending this Thursday.
The SIFC was informed that the Ministry of Energy claimed that the increase in gas prices was 100%. But the PBS put the increase at 1,100%.
The SIFC asked the chief statistician to reconcile the data and the actual price situation should be reported to the next executive committee meeting of the SIFC, said the officials.
PBS reported on Friday that gas prices for the lowest income group were higher by 1,109% during the week ended on January 11, 2024 compared to the same week a year ago.
Inflation has remained sticky and poor people are bearing the brunt. PBS said that inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator skyrocketed to 44.2%.
However, it is unlikely that the PBS would be able to revise prices soon due to various administrative and technical procedures involved in the exercise.
The difference between prices quoted by the PBS and the Ministry of Energy was because of two major reasons. The interim government has slapped fixed monthly charges in the range of Rs465 to Rs2,000 per consumer and is of the view that the fixed charges should not be part of the price increase calculation.
Secondly, the Ministry of Energy is claiming that the majority of consumers were exempt from the price hike.
PBS officials said that after receiving SIFC instructions, the bureau had started reconciling the data. They said that the Ministry of Energy had shared the data of subsidised consumers of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC). But it has not yet shared consumer data of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited.

PBS officials further said that fixed charges were also part of the price increase, as they had a direct bearing on consumers.
PBS reports inflation numbers based on financial year 2015-16. Any revision would have far-reaching implications for other macroeconomic indicators.
It will need the endorsement of a technical committee and the governing council for changing the calculation methodology.
Federal and provincial governments have not been able to contain inflation and the National Price Monitoring Committee has just become a debating body.
The monitoring committee met on Tuesday to review prices and came to the conclusion that an increase of 44.2% in overall prices was “driven by perishable items including tomatoes, onions and poultry products like chicken and eggs,” said a statement issued by the planning ministry.
The planning minister “asked about the measures taken by the provincial governments and Islamabad Capital Territory to curtail the gap between wholesale and retail prices”, it added.
Representatives of the food and industries departments of Punjab, Sindh and K-P claimed that strict monitoring of prices had been ensured through heavy fines, raids and sealing of shops demanding high rates.
However, yet prices of almost every essential good are on the rise.
In its last meeting, the SIFC also took up the challenges being faced in the collection of gas bills in Balochistan and Sindh. The provincial high court had allowed the government to recover provisional gas bills to the tune of Rs5,700 per month, which created resentment among consumers.
Similarly, the Sindh High Court has given a stay order against the recent gas price hike. The SIFC has directed SSGC to file review petitions in both the provincial courts.
Despite the increase in gas prices, the gas sector circular debt has mounted to Rs3.022 trillion as of November end, adversely affecting the financial health of petroleum companies.

1,"PFVA urges R&D for fruits, vegetables","Significance of research, development, diverse varieties, improved quality of vegetables, fruits","Patron-in-Chief of the All Pakistan Fruit & Vegetable Exporters, Importers, and Merchants Association (PFVA), Waheed Ahmed, has emphasised crucial strategies to bolster Pakistan’s fruit and vegetable exports. Speaking at an orientation session for 40 newly-appointed Trade and Investment Officers (TIOs) organised by PFVA, Ahmed underscored the significance of research and development, diverse varieties, improved quality, and addressing quarantine challenges and shelf life issues.
According to a press statement released on Tuesday, he highlighted critical issues obstructing the full realisation of Pakistan's export potential in fruits, vegetables, and value-added products.

These TIOs, stationed in Pakistani embassies worldwide, play a pivotal role in connecting domestic producers with international markets. Ahmed outlined their contributions in market research, identifying new markets, considering factors like demand, competition, and import regulations. Moreover, he urged TIOs to build relationships with importers, negotiate trade deals, and promote high-quality standards.

2,Deadlines on PIA sell-off end,"Govt yet to decide process of selling airliner, fails to acquire statutory audit","The government has missed the deadlines set by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to secure support from official and private creditors for the division of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) into two entities, a prerequisite for privatisation.
Formal decisions have not been made on whether the privatisation ministry aims to sell the airline to a foreign government through negotiations or complete the process transparently through a competitive process, according to Ministry of Privatisation officials. However, during internal meetings, the privatisation minister has hinted at a potential negotiated deal.
A Scheme of Arrangement for segregating PIA into core and non-core entities couldn’t be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) due to the absence of statutory audited accounts of PIA until September 2023 and no objection certificates from creditors, as per government officials.
Secretary Privatisation Jawwad Paul and Secretary Privatisation Commission Usman Bajwa did not respond to questions regarding the missed SIFC deadlines.
Missing these deadlines could jeopardise the caretaker government’s goal to privatise the country’s third-highest loss-making entity before February 8th—the day when the interim cabinet becomes a lame duck.
The Privatisation Commission board has approved the transaction structure to sell a minimum of 51% stake after cleansing its balance sheet by transferring almost three-fourths of the Rs825 billion to a new company. The board also approved setting up a new holding company in which a majority of the airline’s debt could be parked in order to sell it with a clean balance sheet. However, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the federal cabinet have not yet endorsed the board’s decision.
Spokesperson for the finance ministry, Qamar Abbasi, stated that the Ministry of Finance has been fully supportive of the privatisation process of PIA and has been working closely with the Privatisation Commission. He mentioned that the process to finalise the scheme of arrangements was underway, which would pave the way for finalising modalities for managing debt and resolving any other issues.
The SIFC had set January 11th as the deadline to secure no-objection certificates for moving the debt and trade payables of commercial banks, the Civil Aviation Authority, Pakistan State Oil, Federal Board of Revenue, and National Insurance Corporation Limited into a new company, as per officials.
The civil-military body instructed the privatisation ministry to take all pending actions before the end of this month, with strict adherence to timelines.
The SIFC had asked the ministry to decide by January 15th to 20th whether the airline would be sold through a negotiated deal or a competitive bidding process. It also instructed that the scheme of arrangement should be filed with the SECP by January 20th and get its approval. However, these prerequisites have not been met.
Read PC okays 51% PIA stake sale
The privatisation ministry requires statutory audits of PIA accounts until September 30th, 2023, following the International Financial Reporting Standards. Sources said, the audit is incomplete, and the SECP has refused to grant a waiver.
The privatisation ministry was hopeful of obtaining a waiver from the SECP, but the corporate sector preferred to adhere strictly to the established procedures.
The second requirement for filing the scheme of arrangement is securing no objection certificates from commercial banks for their Rs281 billion lending and government entities for their combined lending of Rs162 billion to PIA.
The SIFC had instructed the CAA, PSO, FBR, and NICL to give their NOCs by January 11th. PIA owes Rs120 billion to CAA, and the status of the NOC from CAA remains unclear.
The FBR needs to recover Rs19 billion from PIA, and the NOC from the tax machinery is pending. The status of the Rs19 billion, whether it will be written off or parked in the new holding company, is also unclear.
Similarly, PSO needs to recover Rs20 billion from PIA, and without an NOC, its debt cannot be transferred to a new entity.
The SIFC set a January 31st deadline to find a solution to the legacy loans of PIA and their settlement, but tangible progress hasn’t been made.
Aviation Secretary Saif Anjum was not available for comments.
According to the financial advisor’s report, PIA’s debt and liabilities have surged to a record Rs825 billion. Financial advisors have proposed parking around Rs640 billion in a new holding company.
The Rs825 billion includes Rs457 billion debt, Rs163 billion loan by the Ministry of Finance to PIA, and Rs83 billion debt of foreign creditors. The commercial banks’ debt amounts to Rs281 billion, and PIA also owes Rs65 billion to its employees.
Numerous meetings have been held between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Privatisation to resolve the issue, but the finance minister is reluctant to take PIA’s debt onto the government’s books.
Qamar Abbasi stated that PIA’s debt management was linked with the finalisation of the scheme of arrangement.
The SIFC also set a January 11th deadline to find a solution to the commercial banks’ Rs281 billion debt.

3,"DAP fertiliser sales surge 31%, urea stagnates","Brokerage house reveals offtake trends, highlighting divergence in fertiliser preferences","In the agricultural landscape of Pakistan, the fertiliser sector is experiencing a notable shift as Diammonium Phosphates (DAP) takes the lead with a significant surge of 31% in offtake during the Calendar Year 2023. In contrast, urea, a staple fertiliser for farmers, has seen marginal growth, remaining virtually stagnant over the same period.
According to Optimus Capital Management, urea offtakes for CY23 reached 6,642 Kilo Tonnes (KT), a modest increase from 6,612 KT in CY22. Meanwhile, DAP offtakes for CY23 demonstrated a substantial rise, standing at 1,576 KT compared to 1,201 KT in CY22.
Analysing the total availability, including local production and imports, urea recorded 6,738 KT in CY23, showing a slight drop of 2% from 6,884 KT in CY22. On the other hand, DAP’s total availability witnessed an 11% increase, reaching 1,608 KT in CY23 compared to 1,445 KT in CY22.
The offtakes for Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) experienced an 8% decrease in CY23, standing at 800 KT against 868 KT in CY22. NitroPhos (NP) offtakes, on the contrary, surged by 46% in CY23, reaching 1,085 KT compared to 741 KT in CY22.
Monthly data indicated that in December 2023 a 2.78% uptick in urea offtake, reaching 628 MT, compared to 611 MT in November 2023. However, this marked a 24% decline from the figures in December 2022, which stood at 833 KT.
Read Crackdown ordered against fertiliser hoarders
Conversely, DAP offtake in December 2023 decreased significantly to 138 KT from 278 KT in November, marking a sharp 50% decline. Compared to December 2022 figures of 154 KT, this represented a decrease of 10.39%.
Optimus Capital Management noted that the additional import of 152 KT of urea is expected to maintain fertiliser availability, but as the import price burden is shifted to farmers, no contraction in urea prices is foreseen. Despite the average international urea prices decreasing from $371/tonne to $323/tonne, local prices rose from $278/tonne to $316/tonne, leading to a contraction in local price discounts.
In the Rabi season, DAP prices continued their ascent, reaching $969/tonne in December 2023 against $917/tonne in November 2023. This surge expanded the price premium to 56%, despite international DAP prices remaining relatively stable, according to the brokerage house.

4,Rupee halts two-week winning streak,"Edges down Rs0.01 to close at 280.25/$ amid global uncertainties, balanced market dynamics","The Pakistani currency closed stable at Rs280.25 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Tuesday, breaking a two-week winning streak as demand and supply positions of the foreign currency balanced out.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency edged down Rs0.01 to close at Rs280.25 against the greenback.
Over the past nine consecutive working days, the currency maintained a gradual uptrend, cumulatively gaining 0.59% or Rs1.65. So far, it has strengthened by 9.58% or Rs26.86 in the past four months compared to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported a 0.24% or Rs0.67 day-to-day increase, closing at Rs282.92/$ in the open market.
The stability in the interbank market is attributed to diverse developments, including fluctuations in international oil and gas prices due to the ongoing Middle Eastern crisis.
Global energy supplies faced disruption due to tension rising in the Red Sea, causing uncertainty in future energy prices. Any increase in energy prices could lead to a higher demand for the US dollar in local markets, given Pakistan’s heavy reliance on imported fuels.
Read Rupee strengthens, hits 11-week high
However, energy prices have maintained a downward trend so far, with sufficient fuel inventories reported by the US and Europe. This suggests that commodity prices may continue to decline, reducing demand for the US dollar from local traders.
Stable foreign currency inflows through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDAs) from overseas Pakistanis and the potential receipt of the next International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan tranche of $700 million, following the approval of its immediate release by the executive board, further supported the Pakistani rupee.

5,Hubco in talks to buy stake in Thar coalmine,"Separately, KAPCO plans to acquire 49.5MW wind power project in Sindh","Hub Power Company (Hubco) has kicked off talks to acquire a stake in the country’s top coal-rich mine that is supplying black gold to run power plants, believing that the acquisition will prove financially beneficial.
Besides, Kot Addu Power Company (Kapco) is attempting to acquire a wind power project of 49.5 megawatts located in Sindh, diversifying its operations by embracing clean energy. Hubco said in a notification to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday “the board of directors of Hub Power has authorised the company to enter into negotiations and execute definitive agreements for the proposed acquisition of shares of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company Limited (SECMC) held by a potential seller.”
The company, however, did not mention how much stake it was planning to take in the mining company. The completion of the proposed transaction is subject to necessary corporate and regulatory approvals and consent, and execution of definitive documents, the notification added.
SECMC is operating Pakistan’s first open-pit lignite mine in block-II of Tharparkar in Sindh. Including other blocks, Thar has one of the world’s largest coal reserves of 175 billion tons, which are equivalent to 50 billion tons of oil and 2,000 trillion cubic feet of gas.
“With the current annual mining capacity of 7.6 million tons, we continue to provide lignite quality coal to power producers in Pakistan,” SECMC said on its website. Arif Habib Limited analyst Muhammad Amad said in a commentary the sellers of SECMC’s stake may include Engro with 12% shareholding, Thal Limited another 12% stake, HBL 9% and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) 4%.
“If Hubco acquires the stake from Engro, it is anticipated to positively impact its earnings by Rs0.73 per share (total impact of Rs947 million). A similar outcome is expected if the stake is acquired from Thal Limited,” he said.
“Alternatively, acquiring HBL’s stake would have a positive impact of Rs0.55 per share (or Rs710 million) on the profitability of Hubco. Additionally, Hubco can enhance its stake in SECMC by 4% through the purchase of all CMEC shares, resulting in a positive impact of Rs0.24 per share (Rs316 million).”

Another notification to the PSX said “Kapco has placed a bid to acquire an equity stake in Tenaga Generasi, which owns a 49.5MW wind power project located in Sindh.” The bid, if it is successful, will result in Kapco owning a majority stake in the company.
“Discussions are at the preliminary stage and any potential transaction would be subject to, among others, the execution of definitive documents, regulatory approvals and internal approvals including Kapco shareholders’ approval.”
Amad said the revenue of Tenaga Generasi rose 52% year-on-year in the first nine months of calendar year 2023, arriving at Rs4.7 billion. Additionally, the profit after tax for 9MCY23 showed a robust growth of 65%, amounting to Rs2.8 billion, as opposed to Rs1.7 billion in the corresponding period of last year.
The last 12-month profit after tax for Tenaga Generasi came in at Rs2.7 billion. “We see the company’s valuation settling at Rs9.4 billion ($33.4 million), on the basis of P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) valuation methodology.”
Principal activities of Kapco are the ownership, operation and maintenance of a 1,600MW nameplate capacity multi-fuel-fired power plant (gas, furnace oil and diesel) at Kot Addu, Punjab. The company sells electrical energy to a single customer, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G).
The company’s plant is Pakistan’s largest combined-cycle power plant.

6,"PSX dips below 64,000","KSE-100 index falls 531.91 points, settles at 63,737.46","Continuing its descend, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) moved further south on Tuesday as investors weighed the slim large-scale manufacturing (LSM) growth of 1.59% year-on-year (YoY) , weakening rupee and political uncertainty.
In the morning, the day began with robust trading when the index touched its intra-day high at 64,246.67 points. However, owing to profit-taking and reports saying that the delisting committee had set Pak Suzuki Motor Company’s (PSMC) share price way below expectations at Rs609, the market fell rapidly. As a result, the index dipped below the 64,000 mark, hitting the intra-day low at 63,397.94 before midday. The downturn was also influenced by geopolitical uncertainty and apprehensions surrounding the energy sector’s circular debt that surpassed Rs5.73 trillion.
“Stocks closed bearish as investors weighed the modest LSM growth of 1.59% YoY in November 2023, weak rupee and political noise,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Speculation in the auto sector amid lower-than-expected minimum share buyback price for PSMC, geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over power and gas sector’s circular debt reaching Rs5.73 trillion played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.” At close, the KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 531.91 points, or 0.83%, and settled at 63,737.46.
Topline Securities, in its report, commented that profit-taking dominated Tuesday’s trading activities. “Negativity loomed when the delisting committee set PSMC’s price at Rs609/share, dashing market expectations of a significantly higher valuation,” it said.

Profit-booking marked trading in the E&P sector, leading PPL (-4.14%) and OGDC (-2.97%) to close in the red, Topline added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 407.5 million shares against Monday’s tally of 382.01 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.6 billion.
Shares of 338 companies were traded. Of these, 92 stocks closed higher, 219 dropped and 27 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 50.8 million shares, losing Rs0.06 to close at Rs5.79. It was followed by Pakistan Telecommunication Company with 48.6 million shares, gaining Rs1 to close at Rs13.57 and WorldCall Telecom with 32.1 million shares, losing Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.36. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs56.7 million.

7,Chinese automakers build shipping fleets,Embrace car export boom by operating own vehicle carriers,"BYD Explorer No 1, a vehicle carrier vessel leased to Chinese automaker BYD, held its maiden voyage ceremony on Monday at a port in Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong province.
With more than 5,000 new energy vehicles (NEVs) on board, it will set sail for the ports of Vlissingen in the Netherlands and Bremerhaven in Germany.
It is the first vessel in the shipping fleet of BYD, which has joined a number of Chinese automakers in accelerating car exports by operating their own shipping fleets.
According to China International Marine Containers (Group) Co Ltd (CIMC), the vessel was built by CIMC Raffles, a subsidiary of CIMC, for international ship management company Zodiac Maritime and was leased to BYD.
The vessel was delivered on Tuesday to a construction base in Longkou, east China’s Shandong province, before sailing to Yantai Port to be loaded with the first batch of 1,389 NEVs. On Sunday, the vessel arrived at Shenzhen and was loaded with the second batch of some 4,000 NEVs.
According to China’s General Administration of Customs, China’s auto exports surged to 5.22 million vehicles in 2023, up 57.4% year on year. As the country’s automobile industry embraces a new export era, automakers are grappling with challenges such as soaring rents, shipping capacity constraints, and intense competition for available car carriers.
Data from global shipping research institution Clarksons Research shows that from August 2020 to the end of November 2023, the one-year time charter rate for a 6,500 car equivalent unit (CEU) pure car and truck carrier (PCTC) had soared from $10,000 per day to $115,000 per day, an increase of more than 10 times.
Read Chinese automakers embrace export boom with own shipping fleets
To bolster automobile exports, major Chinese automakers, including BYD, Chery, and SAIC, have ventured into establishing their own fleets. Notably, Guangzhou Shipyard International Company Limited successfully implemented an order for two BYD PCTCs on January 23, 2023, while Chery Group subsequently announced plans to establish its own global shipping fleet.
SAIC’s Anji Logistics, in the past two years, has also ordered a number of large car carriers exceeding 7,000 vehicles each from the Jiangnan Shipyard.
In recent years, the concentration of the global automobile shipping market has remained high, with automakers in Japan, Korea and other countries having deep ties with the transportation link. According to data from the research institute of China Merchants Bank, as of November 2021, the global capacity of the top 10 car transport shipping companies – mainly from Japan, Korea and European countries – accounted for 59.42% of the market share, while the car transport capacity of Japan and Korea is mostly occupied by their domestic car manufacturers.
Previously, China’s status as a major auto exporter was limited, resulting in minimal emphasis on building an independent shipping fleet. Currently, China has 39 car carrier vessels with a total of 115,000 CEU, representing 2.8% of the global shipping capacity.

9,Govt aims to revitalise agri-sector,"Will introduce policies to facilitate corporate farming, foster sustainable growth","The government has outlined a series of initiatives to breathe new life into Pakistan’s agriculture sector. These include the formulation of a national seed policy and the introduction of the Agriculture Development Authority Act to facilitate corporate farming in Pakistan.
Sources informed The Express Tribune that the Ministry of Food has developed several initiatives and is in the process of consulting with all stakeholders, including provincial authorities. These initiatives aim to restructure the agriculture sector, addressing key challenges and fostering sustainable growth.
As part of this plan, the government is considering delisting underperforming seed companies that have failed to contribute positively to the introduction of quality seeds in Pakistan. Fraudulent practices by seed and pesticide companies have led to the collapse of the agriculture sector, with farmers falling victim to poor-quality seeds.
Sources in the food ministry said the ministry presented an action plan in a high-level meeting before the prime minister, outlining various components, including the finalisation of the Federal Seed Policy. The policy draft has been prepared, and consultations with provinces are on the agenda. 
Agricultural Development Act for Corporate Farming
The government envisions opening up the agriculture sector to corporate companies, attracting investment and modern technology to boost crop yields. The Ministry of Food and National Security has prepared a draft for the Agricultural Development Authority Act, which is currently under consultation with provinces.
Under this act, companies can secure large land areas on long-term leases, expecting to bring in capital, machinery, equipment, skilled personnel, and global market connections. Unlike Pakistan’s current small-scale, family-owned, or tenant-operated farms, these corporate farms will be professionally managed, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.
Initial responses to the concept of corporate farming are positive, especially from Gulf countries seeking stable food sources. However, concerns have been raised about potential adverse effects on small farmers, herders, and local consumers, particularly regarding land and water allocation and potential food price hikes.
Framework for Land Usage
The federal government has urged the chief minister of Punjab to share the plan and legal requirements with other provinces to make identified land usable for investors and corporate farming. Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber-Pakhtukhwa (K-P) have been asked to provide timelines for the implementation of legal requirements similar to those followed by Punjab.
Read Despite progress, challenges persist in agriculture sector
The Ministry of Food has also been tasked with sharing comprehensive details, including eligibility criteria, the application process, and terms and conditions for obtaining land for corporate farming.
National Seed Policy
The government plans to rename the Federal Seed Policy as the National Seed Policy. The Ministry of Food Security aims to seek approval from relevant authorities in Pakistan to execute this plan. Additionally, there are plans to provide digital literacy training to Pakistani farmers, enabling them to adopt modern farming techniques. IT companies have initiated various projects globally, leveraging artificial intelligence to revolutionise farming practices. The government aims to integrate these advancements into the agriculture sector.
Restructuring Seed Authority
To modernise the seed industry, the government plans to restructure the Seed Authority. A comprehensive plan is in place to introduce modern techniques and ensure the production and distribution of high-quality seeds. Additionally, underperforming seed companies that have hindered progress in the agriculture sector may face delisting.
Livestock and Horticulture Focus
The food ministry will conduct a market and investment pre-feasibility study in the livestock and horticulture sectors to evaluate investment potential and stimulate growth. The government aims to identify standard and uniform farm-level practices, preparing guidelines for streamlined farming processes at large, medium, and small farm levels. This approach seeks to guide farmers, particularly those with small holdings, toward enhanced productivity.
Overhaul of Departments
In an effort to enhance effectiveness, the government plans to overhaul the Department of Plant Protection and the Animal Quarantine Department. A study is being conducted to evaluate their performance and propose restructuring measures for the future. This initiative is crucial for responding to evolving threats to crops and livestock, implementing efficient quarantine measures, and ensuring overall biosecurity.
