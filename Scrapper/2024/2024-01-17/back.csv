0,SIFC deadline to overhaul FBR set to miss,"Differences between FBR chairman, finance minister over restructuring tax machinery persist","Differences between the Federal Board of Revenue chairman and Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar over restructuring of the tax machinery persisted, as the Inland Revenue Service on Tuesday contemplated going on a strike across the country.
Both the finance minister and the FBR chairman have not been able to resolve the differences with only two days left in meeting a deadline set by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) about submitting a summary for the cabinet.
The SIFC on Jan 3 had in principle approved the FBR’s administrative and legal restructuring and instructed the finance minister to take a summary to the federal cabinet within 15 days for approval.
The FBR chairman has submitted a draft of the summary to the finance minister but there are issues between the top two decision-makers.
There are also differences between the Customs Service Group -the junior partner- and the Inland Revenue Service -the group controlling the FBR administration.
The SIFC had approved to separate the policy function of the FBR and place it with the Revenue Division. It also approved to abolish the FBR and establish two new boards, the Federal Customs Board and the Federal Board of Inland Revenue.
Sources said that the finance minister wanted the chairman of each board to be from the private sector. But the FBR chairman wanted a government servant to head the board due to the nature of the work.

This difference is becoming a hurdle in the finalisation of the summary for the cabinet along with many other sticking points. If the difference persists, the summary might have the dissenting views of the finance minister and the FBR chairman and the matter would then be decided by the cabinet.
The caretaker prime minister is currently visiting Switzerland to attend the Annual World Economic Forum Meeting. Once the summary lands in the cabinet and is approved, it would lead to triggering a host of amendments in multiple laws and rules. However, there is one strong view that it is not the mandate of the caretaker government to unleash such drastic restructuring just three weeks before the elections.
But the Customs Department sees these three weeks the only window where they can be separated from the influential Inland Revenue Service Group.
The matter would also be discussed today (Wednesday) at the Senate Standing Committee on Finance, to be chaired by PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
The FBR’s field formations of Inland Revenue Service on Tuesday contemplated to go on an indefinite strike with effect from 11am against the restructuring. However, the senior FBR management was trying to convince the service to postpone the strike for a few days. Last Friday, the Large Taxpayers Office Karachi observed a token strike against the restructuring, which the officers now wanted to be spread to all 25 offices across Pakistan.

The sources said that the Customs Department had its own set of reservations. The FBR chairman proposed to place the functions of the human resource management, directorate of valuations and the International Taxes with the Revenue Division. But the customs officers were against these proposals.
The SIFC had been informed that the purpose of the FBR’s restructuring was to enhance revenue collection, strengthen governance and accountability, separate policy function to ensure sustainable economic growth and transparency and introduce better oversight mechanisms with steeper accountability.
The Tax Policy Board will be headed by the finance minister and will include experts in taxation, tax policy division and tax administration, economists, and industry experts with no conflict of interest.
The Revenue Division’s mandate will include political coordination across federal and provincial tax matters. It will work to promote revenue and tax policy coordination. The division will also be responsible for integrity policy frameworks, strengthening the tax appellate bodies and modernising the legal and regulatory framework.Functions of the two new boards
The government would appoint the director generals from the Inland Revenue and Customs Groups. The director generals will be the heads of the respective establishments for a fixed tenure.
They will be accountable to the respective oversight boards and will act as principal accounting officers for their respective administrations.
Each board would comprise 10 members – four from the public and six from the private sectors.

1,Torkham border shut as talks remain inconclusive,Pakistan stops entry of Afghan drivers without visa,"The Torkham border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan remained shut for the fourth consecutive day on Tuesday, as a flag meeting between the officials from both sides regarding visa restrictions for the drivers of cargo vehicles remained inconclusive.
Pakistan has made visa mandatory for the drivers of commercial vehicles entering the country from Afghanistan. The measure aimed at improving security, preventing smuggling, and promoting legal bilateral trade.
Because of the closure, hundreds of cargo vehicles were stuck on both sides of the border. At the same time, Pakistan was also losing an average of Rs50 million per day in the form of revenues. For the opening of the border crossing, Pakistani and Afghan officials held a flag meeting, but their talks remained inconclusive.
Security officials said that the federal government imposed the visa requirement for drivers of Afghan cargo vehicles on Nov 1, 2023. The Afghan government was given two-and-a-half-month time to implement the policy.

However, they added, the Afghan authorities did not show any seriousness towards the measure as drivers coming from the other side did not carry their travel documents. The government implemented the visa policy four days ago and stopped the drivers without visas from entering the country.
Qari Nazeem Gul and Kharij Khan, who import and export fresh fruits and vegetables, said that due to the closure of the border crossing, their perishable commodities on more than 100 vehicles had been lost, incurring losses to the tune of tens of millions of rupees.
A customs official, while speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the Pakistan-Afghan bilateral trade generated Rs50 million revenues per day on average. Torkham Transport Union President Haji Azimullah said that a cargo vehicle cost more than Rs15 million.
Azimullah said that the vehicles were taken by the transporters on instalments, adding that the border closure for four days not only affected the tyres and engines of the vehicles, but also dented the earning of the labour, who did not get paid during that period.

A flag meeting was held between Pakistan and Afghan security officials on the border issues at the Torkham Frontier Corps (FC) conference hall. During the meeting, the Pakistani forces stressed that they could not back down from the federal government’s decision of not allowing Afghan drivers entry without visa.
The Pakistan security officials added that the Afghan authorities were not serious in providing the data of their drivers and did not force their drivers to produce travel documents. They stressed that the measures were necessary to prevent smuggling and promote bilateral legal trade.
In response, the Afghan authorities maintained that obtaining Pakistani visa was impossible for Afghan drivers. After the announcement of the new measures, Pakistan had taken special measures for two-way traffic at the Torkham border.

2,Tareen vows to serve people if voted to power,Says providing jobs to youth will be IPP’s first priority,"Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) Chairman Jahangir Tareen on Tuesday pledged to prioritize youth employment and adopt a forward-looking strategy to address the nation's challenges if his party secures power in the February 8 elections.
The IPP chief was speaking during a corner meeting at the residence of the former tehsil nazim Syed Asghar Shah Geelani.
Reposing trust in the people of Lodhran, Tareen noted that the residents of the city gave him respect, adding that it was his responsibility to serve them to “pay back their debt”.
He said after casting their ballots, the voters would acknowledge that they had chosen the “right party”.
The IPP leader maintained that with the passage of time his inclination towards work increased. “The name Lodharan will be heard throughout Pakistan if the people help us succeed,” he said.
Taking a dig at PTI’s founding member Imran Khan, Tareen stated that “everything changed” when the former became the premier.

I started a new party since I had been working for them (PTI) day and night for 10 or 12 years, he said, adding that the prime minister’s seat was a “dangerous thing” while noting that a “monarch thinks that he is everything”.
In a veiled reference to the powers that be, Tareen observed that the individuals who had “appointed him (Imran) as prime minister are likewise forgotten”.
Expressing his resolve to alleviate the burden of masses, the IPP leader emphasized the importance of a forward-looking approach, casting aside the shadows of bygone days.
“Now we have to look into the future. We now need to think about the nation. If Pakistan grows, Lodhran and its people will also grow. Countries are not run like they were run in previous eras,” he said.
“The economy of the country is strong. Providing jobs to the youth will be our first priority. Pakistan should be respected in the world. We have to think for Pakistan,” he added.
Tareen also held meetings with party leaders and workers.
Candidates for PP-228 constituency Nazir Khan Baloch and Syed Asghar Shah Geelani also spoke on the occasion.

3,Justice Isa losing support of bar leaders,Members of Professional Group express disappointment at the SC’s January 13 order," 
Despite the announcement of solidarity by superior bars, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa is losing support from one section of lawyers—the Professional Lawyers Group. The Independent Lawyers Group, also known as the Asma Jahangir Group, holds the majority in the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA).
Currently, this group is aligned with the PML-N, the PPP, and the security establishment. It played a key role in the successful no-confidence motion moved against former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan under Article 95 of the Constitution in March 2022.
The Professional Lawyers Group, which is pro-PTI, is in the minority in both superior bars. However, when the PTI-led government filed a presidential reference against Justice Isa in May 2019, both lawyer groups united in support of the judge.
The leadership of the Professional Group—Muneer A Malik, Salahuddin Ahmed, and Hamid Khan—were even part of Justice Isa's legal team. Hamid Khan had openly criticized PTI’s policy towards Justice Isa. However, members of the Professional Group are now expressing disappointment at the Supreme Court’s January 13 verdict, which dealt a heavy blow to the former ruling party by depriving it of its iconic election symbol—the cricket bat.

They believe the court order will have far-reaching implications for democracy, and the credibility of the upcoming elections is now at stake. PBC member Muneer Kakar, associated with the Professional Group, expressed wonder as to how the SC could deprive citizens of their constitutional right by knocking out one political party on technical grounds.
Meanwhile, the Independent Group demanded that the caretaker government take action against those running a malicious campaign against CJP Qazi Faez Isa. Responding to the call, the federal government has formed a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe into the campaign.
Read Can PTI bat without bat?
CJ Qazi Faez Isa has been facing a malicious campaign on social media since the filing of a presidential reference against him in 2019. Even state institutions were allegedly involved in defaming the judge and his family members. Interestingly, the then-government remained silent on that campaign.
Now, when state institutions require the SC's help to counter the PTI, a JIT is being formed to please SC judges, especially CJP Isa. It is noteworthy that despite facing severe criticism, Justice Isa’s predecessor Umar Ata Bandial had shown restraint.
Some senior lawyers believe that the JIT might have chilling effects on freedom of speech. They said CJ Isa needs to ensure that the JIT is not used to target those who are not in the good books of the establishment. Those who troll judges are on good terms with powerful circles, they claimed.
Interestingly, the JIT will not investigate campaigns launched against high court judges. There is a need to find out the mastermind behind the campaign against Islamabad High Court judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and the Peshawar High Court judges who recently gave relief to the PTI in the election symbol case, they added.

4,CJ Isa calls out PTI’s contradiction,"Top judge to Khosa: ‘Accusations outside, relief inside?’","ISLAMABAD: Calling out its seemingly contradictory stance, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa on Tuesday noted that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) displayed distrust in the judiciary while simultaneously seeking relief.
He made the remarks while a three-member was addressing pending cases when PTI’s lawyer Latif Khosa unexpectedly approached the rostrum to request that the application against former prime minister Imran Khan’s disqualification in the Toshakhana case be scheduled for a hearing.
CJP Isa, responding to Khosa's plea, quipped, ""Latif Khosa saheb, you go out and make accusations. On the one hand, you do not trust the judiciary; on the other hand, you also ask for relief.""
The CJP added that relief would be granted according to the law.
It is pertinent to note that earlier, PTI withdrew its petition seeking contempt proceedings against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), alleging the ECP's failure to ensure a level playing field for the upcoming elections.

The party had filed the plea on December 26, 2023, but decided to withdraw it during the court hearing.
Khosa had informed CJP Isa that PTI would take the matter to the “people's court” rather than pursuing it within the judiciary. He lamented that the January 13 verdict, which deprived PTI of its 'bat' symbol, forced the party to refrain from contesting on more than 230 seats.
In response, CJP Isa questioned Khosa about the continuation of the case, to which Khosa explained that he had been directed to withdraw the plea. He criticised the apex court for ""shattering the PTI's level playing field,"" arguing that the forced independent candidacy of all PTI candidates would create confusion among voters.
However, PTI appears poised for a countermove. Sources earlier told The Express Tribune that the party is gearing up to challenge the top court’s order, with a review petition in the works.
Some legal experts find themselves perplexed by the party's seemingly contradictory stance. While PTI openly expresses mistrust in CJP Isa, its legal team prepares for a review petition—scheduled to appear before the same bench led by CJP Isa.

5,PTI’s Marwat calls off boycott of Sindh polls drive,He earlier halted election campaign due to statements against him by fellow party leaders,"In a major twist, PTI Senior Vice Chairman Sher Afzal Marwat on Tuesday said he would continue the polls campaign in Sindh – hours after he called it off claiming that he was “attacked” by party leaders Raoof Hasan and Hamid Khan.
In a post on social media platform X, Marwat wrote that he would not be distracted and urged the PTI activists to “deal [with] all the satanic forces” on their own. On Sunday, Marwat launched the PTI’s election drive in Sindh but later announced calling it off because of the statements against him by “sick-minded people” like Hamid and Hasan.
“Why these people are targeting me? Did I ever talk against them? I am so disheartened and feel so dejected. We were [supposed] to hold conventions in Sanghar and Nawabshah today but after being attacked by my own party senior lot, I am cancelling all my programmes and events,” he wrote on X.
However, earlier he had described President Arif Alvi of the PTI as a “wrong number”. In videos on social media, he had claimed that Alvi’s son had applied for a PTI ticket but he had opposed the move. Marwat maintained that Alvi had “conspired” against the party.
In response to this statement, PTI’s Hasan, while speaking to a private TV news channel a day earlier, claimed that Marwat did not reflect the party’s position and had no post within it. He added that the PTI “did not own” Marwat’s statements.

Hasan also denied that Marwat met with PTI founding chairman Imran Khan in jail, saying that the deposed premier was only permitted to meet his legal team, sisters and wife. He claimed that no political leader of the PTI had been allowed to meet the party’s founding chairman.
Likewise, PTI’s Hamid -- in a video circulating on the social media – maintained that he did not “recognise” Marwat. He added – similar to what Hasan had said – that Marwat was not representing the party.
Hamid also ruled out internal disputes within the PTI, adding that there were two to three people estranged members, who were trying to create a conflict within the party. However, talking to the media outside Adiala Jail, PTI stalwart Barrister Gohar Ali Khan clarified that Marwat was still a part of the party.
He continued that Marwat would contest the upcoming elections from Lakki Marwat and be victorious. Gohar urged PTI members to set aside their personal differences as he announced that the finalisation of the list of candidates was just around the corner. Conceding that challenges persisted within the PTI, he described internal disagreements as an inherent aspect of the democratic process.

6,Ex-Punjab governor Sarwar 'gravitating towards PPP',"PPP can provide Sarwar an opportunity to become a senator, say sources","With the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) beset by misfortunes, former Punjab governor Chaudhry Sarwar, who joined this party last year with hopes of not only carving out his own political career but also working things around his new party, is inching his way towards the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), sources said on Tuesday.
Sarwar, who had previously been part of PML-N and PTI, joined PML-Q in May last year when the party was reeling from the exodus of former Punjab chief minister Pervez Elahi along with all the party’s then MPAs from Punjab.During his time in PML-Q, Sarwar attempted to breathe new life into the party by recruiting leaders from various backgrounds, though none were particularly prominent.
Sarwar, given that he served two terms as governor and his own interest in constituency politics developed during his governorship, was anticipated to take a leading role in steering the party.However, this could never happen as decision-making control within PML-Q remained firmly in the hands of Chaudary Shujaat’s family.According to sources, it was this lack of his input in decision-making, that forced Sarwar to reconsider his political choices.

The source revealed that Sarwar opposed aligning with the PDM, believing that distancing the party from PML-N would enhance its chances of winning over voters.Sarwar had conveyed to Shujaat and his sons that supporting the PDM government would hinder their chances of winning. However, the PML-Q chose stay in the government and enjoy their ministries.Sarwar recently held two meetings with PPP leadership. The first meeting took place earlier this week when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited his house to offer condolences on the death of his brother Chaudhry Ramzan Pervez.
Sarwar held another meeting with PPPP President Asif Ali Zardari at Bilawal House Lahore on Tuesday.According to the information provided to the media, Sarwar had extended his support for Bilawal Bhutto for NA 127 elections.The source also disclosed that in the coming days, Sarwar would formally announce his decision to join PPP.He mentioned that the reason behind this was PML-Q had no scope of making any comeback, which meant that if Sarwar contests elections post-April, when the bar on him ends, he will get no advantage of being in that party.He stated the main reason is that PPP can provide Sarwar an opportunity to become a senator.

7,Railways chugs ahead with Rs41b earnings,Posts 46% revenue increase in first half of current fiscal,"Defying the odds of floods and financial constraints, Pakistan Railways has steamed into the current fiscal year with raking in Rs41 billion, which is 46% or Rs13 billion more than the earnings in the corresponding period of last year.
This upsurge in revenue in the first six months of 2023-24 can be attributed to a multi-pronged approach adopted by the railways authorities. Passenger traffic played a major role, contributing Rs24 billion, while the freight sector chipped in with Rs11 billion. Other departments also fetched Rs5.5 billion.
The number of operational trains has also seen a boost, with 96 passenger trains plying the tracks compared to 86 last year. The freight trains have also witnessed a similar increase, with the average daily trains running from 3.75 freight trains last fiscal to seven this fiscal.
Addressing concerns about employees’ salaries, officials have assured that the issue has been resolved and will streamline further once the Mainline-I (ML-I) project gains momentum.

Inflationary pressures and rising fuel costs have necessitated fare hikes in both passenger and freight segments, a move expected to bolster revenue in the coming months.
Safety remained a top priority, with a drastic decrease in passenger train accidents reported. Only six minor incidents, with no casualties, occurred on the entire network in the last three months, according to a railways ministry official.
""Only two train accidents have taken place in September, no accident happened in October and four train accidents occurred in November due to effective steps of the department,” he said. “The drastic decrease in accidents has been witnessed due to the efforts being undertaken to reduce trespassing at unmanned level crossings and unauthorised locations, he added.
