Without naming any court, the ECP in a statement pointed out that election symbols were being changed through various forums.
 
 

Following the allotment of election symbols, the ECP said it had already ordered the printing of ballot papers to the three printing corporations and the printing work had started a day before.
“If the process of changing the election symbols continues in the same way, there is a fear of election delay, because the ballot papers will have to be reprinted for which time is already limited and on the other hand, the special paper available for the ballot papers will also be lost,” it reasoned.
 







Officials told not to change symbols allocated to candidates; PPP demands removal of ‘biased ROs’

The commission noted over 33 per cent increase in the number of candidates for the upcoming general elections, as a total of 18,059 are in the run as compared to 11,700 candidates who contested the 2018 polls.
In the 2018 elections, 800-tonne paper was used for printing 220 million ballot papers, while this time the estimate is 2,070-tonne paper for printing of 260m ballot papers particularly after the update of electoral rolls in the backdrop of the delimitation of constituencies.
While the ECP is dealing with this situation, it has repeatedly issued instructions to relevant officials that election symbols should not be changed once the printing had started. However, the statement added, it was also being considered that if the trend of changing the election symbols did not stop, there would be no other option but to postpone the elections in such constituencies.
The ECP earlier barred district returning officers (DROs) and returning officers (ROs) from changing election symbols allocated to electoral candidates for the upcoming elections.
 
 

According to ECP spokesman Syed Nadeem Haider, the ECP directed the provincial election commissioners, DROs and ROs to avoid changing election symbols at this stage, and to seek its approval if a change was essentially required.
Denial of symbol
The directive came just a day after the PPP had raised serious concern over denial of the party election symbol (arrow) to its ticket holders in Punjab and placing them in the category of independent candidates.
Senator Taj Haider, official in charge of PPP’s central election cell, in a letter written to the chief election Commissioner had pointed out that under Section 66 of the Elections Act, 2017, “a declaration before the RO about his affiliation with a particular political party, if any, along with a certificate from the political party showing that he is that party’s candidate from that constituency was the only and the final requirement for ‘seeking allotment of a prescribed symbol’”.
“There is no ambiguity in this Section of the Elections Act, 2017 and it should be followed in letter and spirit,” the letter said. “… the whole system of our constitutional democracy is built around the basic structure of political parties. Accepted that citizens have the option of contesting elections as independent candidates but, we have repeatedly experienced that the presence of independents in an elected house does open an unfortunate window for horse trading and exerting pressures on the elected independents,” it read.
The letter said independent candidates were often elected by taking advantage of ‘parochial, racial, tribal, sectarian and provincial prejudices’ fault lines among the citizens.
“Under Article 33 of our constitution, it is the duty of the state to discourage such and similar such prejudices. Instead citizens should be encouraged to vote on the performance, policies and manifestos of political parties. Pushing valid candidates who are affiliated to a party and also submit required documents before ROs at the time of seeking a prescribed symbol, outside the fold of that party and into the category of independents runs contrary to the provisions of Article 33 and the necessary and sufficient requirements of Section 66 of the Elections Act, 2017,” it said.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), named some of the candidates denied the symbol of arrow in Punjab, along with the symbols allocated to them.
 






According to the PPP, the candidates included Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan Dullah from NA-58 Chakwal, Hasan Sardar from NA-59 Chakwal, Chaudhry Atif Rafique from NA-122 Lahore, Chaudhry Naushad from PP-20 Chakwal, Raja Amjad Noon from PP-21 Chakwal, Mujahid Islam from PP-119 Toba Tek Singh and Muhammad Fayyaz from PP-163 Lahore; some of whom have got relief on court orders.
PPP’s own mistake
An ECP official, when contacted, tried to downplay the controversy over allotment of symbols of independents to PPP candidates by claiming that they were either seeking the symbol of another party when they submitted nomination papers or left the column of party affiliation blank.
“It is inappropriate both for the PPP and its candidates to blame ECP or ROs for their own mistake,” the official said.
Talking to Dawn, Senator Taj Haider questioned why they had been allocated symbols meant for independent candidates, if they had asked for a symbol of another party.
He expressed surprise over the ECP’s directive and said a wrong has to be rectified. “Start of ballot papers’ printing cannot be an excuse,” he remarked.
He said the possibility of ROs drawn from the district administration doing it “under PML-N pressure” cannot be ruled out. He said lack of knowledge of ROs about the relevant law could also be a reason.
Removal of biased ROs
Meanwhile, in yet another letter written to the CEC on Tuesday, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Senator Taj Haider regretted that in spite of agreement of the ECP’s lawyer before the Lahore High Court on allotting the party symbol (arrow) to the PPP candidate from PP 163, ‘the extremely biased returning officer’ of the constituency has raised frivolous objections to the issue of party ticket to candidate Fayyaz Bhatti.
 






Under Section 66 of the Elections Act 2017, he said, the presentation of the party ticket by a candidate to the RO was sufficient proof of affiliation of the candidate with that political party. “It is unfortunate that the RO with mala fide intent continues to obstruct the allotment of the party ticket to our candidate.
“His action and attitude amounts to a clear contempt of the Lahore High Court. In this situation besides requesting that the symbol should be allotted to our candidate without further delay we demand that the biased returning officer should be removed from his position”, the letter reads.
PPP’s election cell member Barrister Amir Hassan alleged that the RO was working at the behest of the rival PML-N to weaken PPP’s vote bank in NA-127 constituency, where PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is in the race.
He alleged that the PML-N being afraid of Bilawal’s entry into the political arena of Lahore was attempting to manipulate the elections through ‘corrupt’ officialdom. He said the party would register its protest against the RO before the Election Commission offices if the party’s election symbol was not allotted to Mr Bhatti.

Soon after his arrest, Mr Rashid was taken to an undisclosed location. He will be produced before the court on Wednesday for remand custody. The AML leader was granted bail in all other cases, except the one case registered with New Town police.
The former interior minister was previously arrested in September last year by the Punjab police during a crackdown against PTI workers and supporters after the May 9 violence.
On Tuesday, former interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and Sheikh Rashid Shafique, a former MNA, appeared before the court. 

AML leader to be brought to court today; LHC reserves verdict on petition challenging acceptance of his nomination papers

The court confirmed the pre-arrest bail of Sheikh Rashid Shafique and Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, but cancelled the bail of the former interior minister in the New Town case.
On Tuesday, the AML leader appeared before the court of ATC-I Judge Malik Asif Ejaz for the hearing of his bail plea. 
Mr Rashid was rounded up by the police in a case registered with the New Town police soon after his bail plea was rejected by the ATC judge.
In a related development, the full bench of the Lahore High Court on Tuesday reserved verdict on a petition challenging the acceptance of Mr Rashid’s nomination papers from NA-56 and NA-57 of Rawalpindi. 
A citizen, Muhammad Arsalan, filed the petition pleading that the respondent was a defaulter of government taxes and he has concealed details of his assets in the nomination papers. 
He asked the full bench to set aside decisions of the ROs and the appellate tribunal regarding the acceptance of the respondent’s nomination papers for Feb 8 general elections.

3,Israeli tanks storm back into parts of northern Gaza,"158 Palestinians killed overnight; death toll hits 24,285.","GAZA: Israeli tanks on Tuesday stormed back into parts of the northern Gaza Strip they had left last week, reigniting some of the most intense fighting since the New Year when Israel announced it was scaling back its operations there.
Massive explosions shook northern areas of Gaza from across the border with Israel — a rarity over the past two weeks after Tel Aviv announced a drawdown of forces from the area as part of a transition to smaller, targeted operations.
The rattle of gunfire reverberated across the border through the night. In the morning, contrails snaked through the sky as Israel’s Iron Dome defences shot down rockets fired across the fence.
Israel claimed its forces had killed “dozens” of Hamas fighters overnight in clashes in Beit Lahiya, on Gaza’s northern edge.
 






Health authorities said the last 24 hours of Israeli bombing had killed 158 people in the Palestinian enclave, raising their toll for the war to 24,285, with thousands more bodies feared lost in the rubble.

158 Palestinians killed overnight; death toll hits 24,285

The Israeli bombardment has driven nearly all Gazans from their homes, some several times, and caused a humanitarian crisis, with food, fuel and medical supplies running low.
Change of plans
Some of the hundreds of thousands of residents who fled the north in October had begun returning last week to bombed-out areas where the Israelis had withdrawn. But residents said on Tuesday the resurgence of fighting in the north would now halt plans to try to go home.
“We almost planned to return to our house in Nazla, east of Jabalia, but thank God we didn’t. This morning people living nearby arrived here and told us the tanks pushed back there,” said Abu Khaled, 43, now living with relatives in severely damaged Gaza City.
“The sounds of bombing from the tanks, from the planes didn’t stop all night. It reminded us of the first day of the ground incursion.”
 






Israeli forces have fought their way to the centre of Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Yunis, and into towns north and east of the central city of Deir Al Balah.
Israeli commando forces carried out targeted raids in Khan Yunis to “take out Hamas’s infrastructure”, including offices of several senior regional commanders, the military said.
The Gaza crisis has inflamed tensions across the region, including in the Red Sea, where the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls most of Yemen has been attacking commercial ships. The route is used by 15pc of world shipping.
The United States and Britain responded by bombing Yemen to prevent what they called a threat to global commerce.

5,Trump moves closer to Biden re-match after big Iowa win,Victory demonstrates ex-president’s success in turning his prosecutions into a rallying cry,"DES MOINES: Donald Trump has romped to a landslide victory in Iowa’s caucuses — the first vote in the US presidential race — cementing his status as the presumptive Republican standard-bearer to challenge President Joe Biden in November’s election. 
The former president has led polling for more than a year, but the contest offered the clearest insight yet into his ability to convert that advantage into a stunning White House return. 
Major US networks took just half an hour to call the race, with Trump taking 51 per cent of the vote on Monday and opening an unprecedented 30-point gap over Ron DeSantis — the biggest victory for an Iowa challenger in modern history. 
The Florida governor and Trump’s other main rival — former UN ambassador Nikki Haley — were locked at 21pc and 19pc, respectively, with DeSantis projected to take the runner-up spot. 

Victory demonstrates ex-president’s success in turning his prosecutions into a rallying cry

“Trump is the dominant candidate (in the Republican Party) and ‘contest one’ confirms the reality,” Julian E. Zelizer, professor of Public Affairs at Princeton University, said. 
There had been questions whether Trump would be hamstrung by his legal problems, as he faces multiple civil and criminal trials this year. 
But the extent of his victory demonstrated the 77-year-old’s success in turning his prosecutions into a rallying cry that has galvanised his followers as he takes his momentum into New Hampshire, the next state to nominate, next Tuesday. 
“I really think this is time now for everybody, the country, to come together,” Trump said in a rambling, uncharacteristically lackluster victory speech. 
Heart doctor Allan Latcham, 62, who voted before heading to Trump’s election party in Des Moines, hailed a “night for victory,” although he admitted he was surprised by the speed of the result call. 
DeSantis weakened 
Bundled up Iowa residents shuffled into more than 1,600 voting locations, braving sub-zero temperatures in a winter storm that dulled turnout and forced candidates to cancel events at the last minute. 
The margin of Trump victory was always the main question of the night, with analysts arguing that a gap of more than 30 points, or a voting share upwards of 50pc, would count as a good night. 
DeSantis confirmed that he would stay in the race to “reverse the madness that we’ve seen in this country” — although the governor is considered weak in New Hampshire and many analysts were declaring his campaign all but dead.
“Big winner tonight? Biden. He’s gonna get the candidate he wants: Trump,” Republican political consultant Mike Madrid posted on social media. 
Haley, the only woman in the Republican contest, was looking to outperform expectations in Iowa and ride into a one-on-one match-up with Trump in her preferred battleground of New Hampshire. 
Despite her third place finish, Haley dismissed DeSantis’s chances of building on his Iowa support level, and she vowed to avert the “nightmare” of a Trump-Biden rematch by winning in New Hampshire. 
Trump aides have been clear they want to see off the competition long before the Republican National Convention in July — and are keen for the party to coalesce around the front-runner before multiple expected court dates. 
But some Republican voters said they could not back another Trump presidency.
