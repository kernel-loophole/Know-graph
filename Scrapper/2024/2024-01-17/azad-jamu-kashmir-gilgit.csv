3,Pakistan Post starts delivery of vehicle docs,Initiative marks significant leap in convenience and efficiency,"In a ground-breaking development, the Pakistan Post has commenced the direct delivery of computerised smart vehicle registration cards and number plates to the doorsteps of the citizens in the garrison city.
The initiative, which started Tuesday, marks a significant leap in convenience and efficiency. 
It aims to streamline and enhance the distribution process for transport owners and citizens.
The Rawalpindi General Post Office (GPO) received the initial batch of cards, which were part of an agreement between the Punjab Excise Taxation and Narcotics Control Department (ETNCD) and Pakistan Post. 
This collaboration focuses on providing a seamless, door-to-door service for the issuance of computerised smart vehicle registration cards and number plates.
Read  Virtual registration launched for swift vehicle processing
The ETNCD, after a pause of approximately seven months, has resumed the preparation of smart registration cards, underscoring the commitment to the agreed-upon collaboration. From July to August 2023, an impressive 7,000 computerised smart cards for vehicles and motorcycles were issued. 
However, delays and challenges in production and delivery have been persistent for the last two years.
The current backlog includes 30,000 smart cards and 45,000 computerised number plates registered in the Rawalpindi district.
Talking to The Express Tribune, the department sources confirmed that the production of smart cards resumed, with plans to complete the pending batch and dispatch them to owners by March. 
Simultaneously, preparations for the production of computerised number plates were set to commence within the next two weeks.
This innovative approach by Pakistan Post not only addresses the challenges faced in the previous years but also signifies a customer-centric commitment to providing efficient, doorstep services, making the process of obtaining smart registration cards and number plates a more convenient experience for the citizens of Rawalpindi.

4,Pindi’s water overhaul gets ADB boost,International bidding for Rs35b DREAMS project kicks off,"The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) in collaboration with the Punjab Local Government and Community Development (LG&CD) department has kicked off the process of international bidding to award the contract for the ‘Developing Resilient Environment and Advancing Municipal Services’ (Dreams) project to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with Rs35 billion cost.
The projects of Chahan Dam, laying of a new pipeline inside the old water pipeline from Rawal Dam Lake to Syedpur, Rawalpindi and round-the-clock water supply to Khayaban-e-Sir Syed will be completed under the Dreams initiative.
The Chahan Dam project will provide 12 million gallons of water per day, while a new water pipeline to bring water from the Rawal Dam Lake will overcome the current leakages of the huge amount of water from the old pipeline. A 24-hour water supply project has also been planned for the Khayaban-e-Sir Syed area, for which the water coming from Khanpur Dam will be used.
The caretaker federal government and the Punjab government have completed negotiations with the ADB for funding the project. Both sides will sign an accord for the availability of funds soon.

The LG&CD department has set up a Project Management Unit (PMU), while the project will be executed by Wasa. The contract of the project will be awarded after the completion of international bidding. The project will help resolve the burning issue of non-supply of water to Rawalpindi.
Meanwhile, water experts have raised the alarm over depleting levels of groundwater. They said tube wells that were currently pumping water with struggle as the water levels deplete further. It would also become expensive due to rising electricity tariffs. Moreover, the continuously decreasing water table has made supplying water from underground sources an expensive exercise for the government.

Background
Rawalpindi’s daily water requirements stand at 68 million gallons, while the current supply from tube wells at Rawal Dam and Khanpur Dam only amounts to 51 million gallons.
Consequently, the city faces a daily water deficit of 17 million gallons.
To address this shortfall, WASA will secure an additional five million gallons of water daily by installing a 10-kilometre steel pipeline from Rawal Dam to Rawalpindi, replacing the old and deteriorated cemented pipeline. Simultaneously, the Chahan Dam project was expected to provide 12 million gallons of water per day.
Together, these measures will cover the daily water deficit of 17 million gallons.

The webinar titled ""Potential of Agrifood Systems and Mitigating Climate Impacts"" was organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in the federal capital. The event was participated virtually by many participants including members of academia, media and the development sector.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)’s representative in Pakistan, Florence Rolle, speaking on the occasion, said climate change is real and couldn’t be denied anymore. She added that Pakistan would have to adapt to climate change and extend effective incentives to its farmers in water conservation and crop productivity through alternative crops ensuring crop diversification.

She said due to rising temperature variability the country could focus on early crop sowing that could help generate more produce with the available water and resources provided the growing shift in pattern.
Rolle said there was a need to revisit the agriculture sector of Pakistan by farming systems and observe its weather patterns which will be the best combination of crop farmers and systems. ""One billion people in the world couldn’t afford a healthy diet in the past years. The current agriculture food policy isn’t providing the desired relief and it's a window opportunity to revisit the policy,"" she maintained.
Rolle said there is an opportunity for Pakistan to improve the system and repurpose it to create more opportunities. ""There is also a need to look into public access to diversified food which is safe along with ensuring food security, and food control systems that could bring elements for dialogue and look into the potential of diet, export of the commodities,"" she added.
She noted that data is important and Pakistan has developed varieties of species related to crop products.
