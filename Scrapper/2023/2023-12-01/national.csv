0,First-ever gender bond launched,"Bond worth Rs2.5b aims to narrow gender gap, boost socio-economic development","Pakistan has launched the first-ever South Asian gender bond worth Rs2.5 billion at the country’s stock market on Thursday, taking the lead in financially empowering women through disbursing the fund and beating the leading economies on the front in the region.
While speaking in an online address at the launch ceremony of 'Pakistan and South Asia’s First Gender Bond' at Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar said this is a historical and groundbreaking occasion as “the dream comes true.”
She said we are living in an environment of gender-gap societies. The fund will help narrow the gap, as it will help some 30,000 women to benefit financially and upgrade their lifestyles.
The fund will provide economic opportunities to marginalised women, gaining access to education and healthcare facilities among other socio-economic upgradation and expedite the drive for financial inclusion.
The finance minister said this is a wake-up development for all to acknowledge that women's participation is a must for socio-economic development and economic growth. Women make up over 50% or Pakistan’s population.
“Our country currently ranks at 145 out of 146 countries on the global gender gap report 2022,” she said, and sets a target to launch a Rs100 billion gender bond to improve the ranking in the future.
The government has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to advancing gender equality in Pakistan, aligning with both the country’s constitutional principles and its international obligations.
Akhtar, who is also the chairperson of PSX, acknowledged the pivotal role of two leading women, “the best women in the financial field (in Pakistan),” in the formation and the launch of the fund including InfraZamin, Chief Executive, Maheen Rahman and Kashf Foundation, Founding Managing Director, Roshaneh Zafar.
Kashf Foundation, CFO, Shahzad Iqbal said they have raised Rs2.5 billion from investors, including financial institutions like mutual funds and pension funds. “Financial institutions’ contribution stands at 50% in the fund.”
This is a three-year term finance certificate (TFC). “We will disburse financing from the fund to women only ""at an interest rate of 20%.”

This will not only allow women in the flood-hit areas to rebuild their homes, but working women will also be able to acquire financing through microfinance institution (Kashf) throughout Pakistan. “They (women) are required to approach us with a copy of their CNIC (identity card) only, and that is enough to avail the financing.”
The funds’ units will be available for trade among the general public at the PSX in about a month's time, he said. British Deputy High Commissioner in Karachi, Sarah Mooney said the gender bond has the ability to “leave a significant and genuine change for the people of Pakistan.”
Pakistan is facing challenges of climate change and population growth. “We are running a number of programmes to address the issues,” she said.
The UK remains a longstanding and strong partner of Pakistan in its efforts for economic development.
PSX, MD and CEO, Farrukh Khan, said the fund was missing for quite a long time to boost economic development in Pakistan. “Women’s empowerment will grow Pakistan's economy's size by 60% larger.”
PSX has included sustainable development goal-5 (SDG-5), which is about gender equality, in both the corporate governance and in its criteria for the top 25 companies award at the bourse.
In 2022, as many as 98 companies were shortlisted on the criteria for the award on the criteria and 65 of them have started reporting on gender equality.
InfraZamin, Chief Executive, Maheen Rahman said they have issued a ‘AAA+’ rating for the fund to attract financial institutions to invest in the fund. “We have guaranteed the risk of default.”
She said the recovery ratio of such microfinance stands at 99.5%, putting only half a percentage point of the financing at risk in the country. “We are aimed at developing the debt market at PSX.”

1,"FBR exceeds tax target, avoids mini budget","Amasses nearly Rs3.5tr, on track to achieve goal set by IMF","The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has surpassed the revenue collection target for the fifth consecutive month, amassing nearly Rs3.5 trillion, remaining on track to achieve the goal set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and avoiding the need for a mini-budget.
The tax authorities collected Rs34 billion more than the target set for the July-November period of this fiscal year on the back of an exceptionally healthy increase in direct taxes. It was the fifth consecutive month that the FBR has exceeded its monthly target, although the goal was steeper in November.
The growth in revenue collection was also nearly 30%, beating the inflation rate, but the GST collection was not as high as it should have been. Against the July-November target of Rs3.45 trillion, the FBR provisionally collected Rs3.84 trillion, according to FBR officials. Tax receipts were Rs34 billion higher than the five-month target, helping avoid any pressure from the IMF for a mini-budget.
According to an understanding reached with the IMF, the FBR would monthly intimate the global lender about progress in its revenue collection. In case of a revenue shortfall in any month, the FBR would trigger back-up measures that include the imposition of excise duties and withdrawing sales tax exemptions.
An IMF technical mission is already in town for a two-week review of the country’s taxation system. The FBR achieved close to 30% growth in tax collection and got Rs791 billion more than the last fiscal year. During the first five months of the previous year, it had received revenues of nearly Rs2.7 trillion.
Low tax collection has remained a chronic issue as taxation has skewed towards the indirect mode, hurting poor people the most. The trend has started reversing, with the share of direct taxes increasing to 45% during the first five months, thanks to better collection from real estate and commercial banks.
The FBR chairman said that import restrictions also helped lower the share of import taxes and correct the share of direct taxes in overall revenue generation efforts.
Read: IMF sees $8b dip in debt in two years
The share of import taxes, which was once equal to 53% of the total tax collection, has now dropped below 40%, thanks to restrictions on imports to preserve the precarious reserves of $7.2 billion.
Despite imposing heavy taxes in the last fiscal year, the FBR collected Rs7.164 trillion, hardly equal to 8.6% of the national economy. One reason for the low collection was the political patronage of tax-evading sectors like real estate, traders, stock market, and exporters.
For the current fiscal year, Pakistan has agreed with the IMF that it will strive to collect Rs9.415 trillion in taxes. The FBR did not change the revenue target, nor did it recommend a mini-budget during the recently concluded first review talks. Out of the four types of taxes – income tax, sales tax, federal excise duty (FED), and customs duty, the FBR met only income tax and FED targets.
Income tax collection amounted to nearly Rs1.57 trillion, up Rs463 billion, or 42%, during the first five months of the current fiscal year. Income tax collection was about Rs221 billion more than the target, offsetting the impact of missed sales tax and customs duty targets.
Sales tax remained the weakest area as its collection reached Rs1.255 trillion, which was Rs186 billion, or 17%, more than the last fiscal year. But the amount was Rs95 billion less than the target due to low growth in tax receipts at the import stage. Still, the FBR collected 61% of its sales tax or Rs770 billion at the import stage.
The FBR collected Rs222 billion in FED with 63% growth. It was Rs17 billion more than the five-month target. The collection of customs duty stood below the target by Rs114 billion.

2,An ‘outstanding’ performance,"Economy grows 2.1% in Q1, rupee stabilises and PSX hits record highs","Pakistan’s business community has shown great confidence in the caretaker government, fully backed by the military, led by Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir.
Its performance has remained “outstanding” in a short period of about three and a half months, which includes economic growth of 2.1% in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, the rupee remaining stable around Rs285/$ over the past two weeks and the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) registering the fastest growth in 20 years at 50% in only five months, hitting a record high above 61,000 points.
Recently, the National Accounts Committee (NAC) has reported the economic growth at 2.1% for the Jul-Sept quarter. However, it revised down the growth rate to negative 0.17% for the previous year ended June 30, 2023 from the earlier reported 0.3% expansion.
Pakistani currency has regained almost 8% (or Rs22) to Rs285/$, recovering from the historical low of Rs307/$ hit in the first week of September 2023.
PSX’s benchmark KSE-100 index has tested all-time highs above 61,000 points compared to the five-month low of around 40,000 points reached in June 2023.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Chief Executive Officer Shahid Ali Habib said “the caretaker government’s economic performance has remained outstanding. It has taken a number of measures to stabilise the economy, which will provide a strong ground for the much-needed growth.”
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) President Malik Bostan said “the caretaker government has taken tremendous economic measures in a very short period of three and a half months (Aug 15 to Nov 30, 2023).”
“It is believed that it will continue to do economic wonders in its remaining rule till early February 2024.”
PSX MD and CEO Farrukh H Khan said that timely completion of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review played a pivotal role in taking the market to new highs.
The review would lead to the release of next tranche of $700 million sometime in December and unlock another $1.5-2 billion in financing from other multilateral and bilateral creditors, he pointed out.
AHL CEO Habib added that the biggest positive initiative taken by the caretaker government was the end to gas subsidies, upward revision in the fuel price and control over the power-sector circular debt.
Apart from that, foreign direct investment (FDI) is being attracted through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). “This is a great achievement,” he remarked. They have stabilised the rupee-dollar parity, boosting investors’ confidence. At the same time, inflation has peaked out.
Keeping that in view, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to cut its key policy rate by seven percentage points to 15% over the next 13 months till the end of December 2024.
“All such developments have improved the ecosystem,” he said, pushing the PSX to a new record high. The market is projected to further rise 25-30% to 75,000-80,000 points, AHL Research projected. Most importantly, the government’s plans to privatise the loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are highly encouraging, if it successfully stops the bleeding of precious financing by such institutions.

“They (caretaker government) should fast-track the privatisation of institutions as the next government after February 2024 polls may derail the process a little bit,” Habib emphasised.
Commenting on the stock market’s record-breaking spree, PSX MD Farrukh Khan pointed out that the caretaker government had taken some tough economic decisions which were supporting the ongoing rally at the PSX.
“The market has surged ... in the wake of early signs of economic recovery and the announcement of general elections date,” he added.
ECAP President Bostan said the IMF and World Bank had praised the economic measures taken by the caretaker government, adding that the economic turnaround was the greatest sign of the positive steps.
He cited a survey conducted by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI), which showed an improvement of seven percentage points in business confidence in the previous six month. “This is a self-explanatory statement from the trade body of foreign investors.”
In one of the significant steps, the government has succeeded in stabilising the rupee-dollar parity through a crackdown on foreign currency smugglers and hoarders as “administrative measures had been due for a long time”.
The caretaker government has also unearthed water and power theft worth over Rs200 billion. SIFC, with the backing of Pakistan Army, was also attracting $50-100 billion investment in Reko Diq mining project, IT and telecom sectors and agriculture, he said.
Among other recent developments, Pakistan’s regional exports increased 14.21% in four months while Kazakhstan was looking for more textile imports from Pakistan, offering a $2 billion market. Meanwhile, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is working on 40 ambitious projects to revolutionise the agriculture sector in Pakistan. Besides, the Economic Coordination Committee of the cabinet has approved Rs423 million in supplementary grant for targeted gas projects in Sindh.
Recently during the prime minister’s visit, Pakistan and Kuwait signed seven MoUs in the areas of manpower, energy and defence, sealing $10 billion in investment deals.
Also, Pakistan and the UAE inked MoUs worth billions of dollars. The emirate’s mineral giant NT plans to invest around Rs2.5 billion in establishing a mineral-based venture in Pakistan.
The government has decided to launch Rs6.8 billion worth of health programmes, ordered the illegal Afghan nationals to return to their home and put curbs on the illegal entry of goods under ATT.

3,FBR staff unveiled as non-filers,"Hundreds of FBR employees failed to file tax returns, wealth statements","Hundreds of employees of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) are chronic non-filers, exposing them to the risk of severe penalties and putting the resolve of the tax administration to broaden the national tax base to the test.
Official documents and background interactions with the tax authorities revealed that a large number of the employees of the FBR have not filed their tax returns for tax years 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Some have filed returns for one year but then did not file their annual statutory income tax and wealth statements for another two years, showed the documents. In certain cases, the returns were not filed for the current tax year whose last extended date for filing was October 30th.
When contacted, Chairman FBR Amjad Zubair Tiwana said that all those FBR officers who have not yet filed their returns would receive notices by Saturday. Tiwana said that a majority of these non-filers got extensions for filing returns, which expired on Thursday.
The chairman said that the non-compliant officers are now at risk of administrative measures, including disconnection of their utility connections.
A senior FBR officer said that out of over 3,200 total officers in the pay scales of 17 to 22, nearly 2,600 have submitted their tax statements for this year.
However, details showed that in addition to about 600 officers, hundreds of non-gazetted FBR employees have not filed their annual income tax returns and wealth statements. It is widely believed that low-ranking employees, particularly income tax inspectors and appraisers of the Customs department, also indulge in corrupt practices. It is not just their salary that makes it binding for them to file their returns, the nature of their assets also require low-grade officers to file their annual income tax returns and wealth statements.
“Non-filing of returns by the employees of FBR is quite upsetting for us as an organisation and needs to be addressed on an urgent basis,” reads a letter written to the head of one field formation of Karachi where as many as 307 employees did not file their returns.
The head of the field formation was instructed to immediately direct his chronic non-filers fellows to submit their returns, according to the documents.
The law binds all citizens of Pakistan, including civilian and military, to submit their annual tax returns if their annual income is Rs600,000 or more, or a person owns a home, or a car of 1,000 cc. The statutory deadline was September 30th, which the FBR extended till October.
The law allows that the taxpayers can seek individual extension which some of the FBR officers availed but others did not.
The FBR chairman on Wednesday informed the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that the board has decided to exercise powers to suspend mobile Sim cards, electricity and gas connections of non-filers. He said that these measures are being taken to expand the tax base to nearly 6.9 million filers by June next year.
Read: FBR exceeds tax target, avoids mini budget
However, the FBR has not yet exercised these powers against its own employees. Many officers have been non-filers for the past three years.
The FBR chairman further informed the committee that so far only 3.3 million people had filed their taxes for this year – a figure that he has to more than double in the remaining seven months to achieve the goal of 6.9 million filers.
The government has already notified a committee under a serving three-star general, Lt General Munir Afsar, for broadening of the tax base.
There are nearly 17,000 sanctioned posts of the Inland Revenue Service across Pakistan and another 9,500 of Pakistan Customs, making it one of the larger civilian organisations of the country.
The FBR chairman further informed that there were 11.4 million registered people for income tax purposes but only 3.3 million or 29% filed their mandatory statements.
Instead of immediately proceeding against its employees, the FBR has directed the head of its field formations to recover the penalty from the salaries of the non-filers after December 31st, according to the documents.
In the case of another large tax office of the country, there were 183 non-filers, showed details. These include both officers and officials serving against low pay scales.
Although the FBR has not moved decisively against its own employees, the field formations have reached out to the country’s top companies with a reminder to ask their employees to fulfill their legal requirement of filing returns.
The documents showed that where one FBR field office has restricted service-related benefits of non-filers, those serving in 25 other FBR offices were still receiving those benefits.
The low tax base due to the exclusion of sectors like real estate, exporters, and agriculture has shifted the entire burden on a few classes – the salaried class and industrialists. The salaried class is paying almost 300% more tax than the country’s richest exporters.
Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio dropped to 9% during the last IMF programme period and in spite of a $400 million World Bank loan for the FBR to broaden the tax base and fixing the ills of the taxation system.

5,'Businessmen must follow best practices',"President asks traders to adopt honesty, fairness to grab space in global economy","President Dr Arif Alvi on Thursday urged the traders and businessmen in the country to strictly adhere to the principles of honesty and fairness to capture a space in the competitive global economy.
Addressing the achievement recognition ceremony of the Islamabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industries (ICSTSI), at the Aiwan-e-Sadr, the president said it was difficult to have a successful business if the customers did not trust a brand or considered it dishonest.
President Alvi said in a competitive economy, businesses that fail to create an ethical reputation soon become extinct. “Sell your products with fairness by maintaining the same standards which you show to your target audience while marketing,” he urged traders.
Besides adopting a profit-based approach, he said, it was equally important for companies to ensure an environment of empathy and compassion in society. “Honesty in public dealing and developing trust between supplier and consumers can lead to an accommodating atmosphere in the society,” he suggested.

The president emphasised on inculcating the values of honesty in the society in line with the glorious teachings of Islam which called for maintaining integrity in public dealings. He also noted that it was the responsibility of the society to provide a harassment-free environment to women at workplaces to ensure their inclusion in all fields of life.
Dr Alvi said the promotion of small industries in the country could stimulate economic growth. He highlighted the need for skill development through vocational courses to help the population earn the dividends of a skill-based economy.
“There is no dearth of talent and skills in the country however, the situation needs provision of better opportunities to people.”

6,PSX ends nearly flat on profit-booking,"KSE-100 index creeps up 29.27 points, settles at 60,531.27","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday closed nearly flat as it crept up just 29 points owing to profit-taking by investors, which restricted the market from making big leap in line with the recent trend.
The KSE-100 index remained volatile despite the emergence of positive economic indicators in recent weeks. The rollover of $3 billion in Saudi deposits in the State Bank of Pakistan, increase in exports and remittances and court’s stay order against the collection of windfall tax from banks were among the encouraging factors.
“Stocks showed recovery amid rollover of $3 billion in Saudi deposits, fall in treasury bond yields and court’s stay against the recovery of over Rs35 billion in windfall tax from banks,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Reports of surging exports, improving key economic indicators and easing geopolitical uncertainty also played the role of catalysts in positive close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded narrow gains of 29.27 points, or 0.05%, and settled at 60,531.27.
Topline Securities, in its report, wrote that the KSE-100 index opened on a positive note and touched the intra-day high of 480 points. However, sceptical investors turned to profit-booking, pulling the index down, which finally settled at 60,531, up 0.05%.
Major positive contributors were Millat Tractors, Lucky Cement, Hub Power, Fauji Fertiliser and Systems Limited, cumulatively adding 311 points to the index.
On the flip side, MCB Bank, Engro, United Bank, TRG Pakistan and Mari Petroleum dragged the index down by 254 points, it said.
The MSCI semi-annual rebalancing was observed during the day. There were no additions and deletions in the main MSCI Frontier Index. However, in its small-cap index, Agha Steel, AGP Limited, Pak Suzuki Motor and Sazgar Engineering were added whereas Faysal Bank, Kohat Cement, Maple Leaf Cement and Shell Pakistan were removed, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) noted that despite a whopping 16.5% month-on-month rise, the KSE-100 came down from all-time highs. “Seasonality factor remains favourable for higher stock prices into the end of January with the target at 65k,” it said.
Globally, Pakistan ranked the fifth strongest market with US dollar returns of 15.4% (after Argentina +33%, Israel +18%, South Korea +16% and Spain +15.5%).
November was a very strong month for foreign inflows with net buying of over $30 million, a number last seen in 2019, AHL said.
Key index movers were Millat Tractors (+7.5%), Lucky Cement (+4.03%) and Hub Power (+2.15%) while major drags were MCB Bank (-3.53%), Engro (-2.31%) and United Bank (-1.73%), it added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal said that the bourse witnessed a range-bound activity as the KSE-100 index touched the high and low of 60,982 and 60,428 points, respectively.
“Going forward, we expect range-bound activity to continue and recommend investors to view any downtrend as an opportunity to buy stocks in cement and textile sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 467.2 million shares compared with Wednesday’s tally of 692.2 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs18.8 billion.
Shares of 379 companies were traded. Of these, 148 stocks closed higher, 212 dropped and 19 remained unchanged.
Fauji Foods was the volume leader with trading in 34.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.54 to close at Rs9.05. It was followed by Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim with 33.02 million shares, gaining Rs1.67 to close at Rs24 and WorldCall Telecom with 28.1 million shares, losing Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.51.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs1.14 billion, according to the NCCPL.

7,Industrialists announce shutdown on Dec 4,Insist high gas tariffs make all industrial zones uncompetitive,"Industrialists of Karachi have announced a strike on December 4 to protest the whopping and unaffordable gas tariffs, which have made all seven industrial zones of the port city unviable and uncompetitive.
They have called for applying forthwith the reduced gas tariff of Rs1,350 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) determined by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
Other industrialists and trade bodies of Sindh and Balochistan including the Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Nooriabad, Kotri and Hyderabad had expressed their solidarity and fully supported a complete shutdown.
Speaking to journalists at a press conference held at the conference office of the SITE Association of Industry (SAI) on Thursday, the industrialists said it was the third press conference in a series of protests against the soaring rates of gas but no top government official or policymaker had approached the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to fix the problems.
They wore black armbands and banners were hanging on walls with demands that the government do justice with the industrialists of Karachi and Sindh.
“After a series of protests and press conferences, now we announce a complete closure of all industries on December 4 (Monday), if the legitimate demand of fixing gas tariff at Rs1,350 per mmBtu is not met by the government,” said an industry leader.
Only the industries of Karachi export $47.69 million (or Rs13,754 million) of goods per day. If industrial zones of the port city are closed just for one day, it will be a major loss to the national economy.
Businessmen had appealed to the government to reduce gas tariffs to Rs1,350 per mmBtu, which had been determined by Ogra as the 100% cost of gas including around 22% profit for Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), said Businessmen Group Vice Chairman Jawed Bilwani.
He said the new gas tariffs had burdened industries with a cross-subsidy for providing unfair support to fertiliser, power and domestic sectors.

“The industry demands fair gas tariffs and will never accept the unbearable rates ranging from Rs2,100 to Rs2,600 per mmBtu, which have been imposed to please the fertiliser, domestic and power sectors, and penalise the industrial sector that forms the backbone of the economy,” he reiterated.
SAI President Muhammad Kamran Arbi urged the government to hold a meeting with industry stakeholders to reach consensus on gas prices since the existing tariffs had outgrown the manufacturing costs.
“If a small unit was paying a gas bill of Rs1 million, now it has to foot the bill of around Rs2 million. Around 71 industrialists of the SAI have approached and informed me that they are unable to run their units in the current economic crisis,” he revealed.
Arbi said the business community expected the promised winter package for incremental consumption of electricity as it was agreed to provide electricity at a reduced tariff of Rs20 per unit on incremental consumption during four months of winter.
Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI) President Syed Raza Hussain said high tariffs took a heavy toll on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which had started reducing their operations.
“If a factory used to run three shifts, it is now running two shifts. SMEs can be closed gradually and workers will be rendered unemployed,” he added.
Earlier, a large number of industry workers protested outside the SAI.

8,Saudi loan rollover props up rupee,Currency reaches one-week high at Rs285.17 to a dollar,"Pakistani currency on Thursday edged up to a one-week high at slightly above Rs285 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on the back of some improvement in foreign currency inflows in the country.
A day ago, Saudi Arabia rolled over its $3 billion in deposits at the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for another year by the end of December 2024.
Pakistan was liable to repay the funds to the kingdom next month but the rollover is expected to ensure the much-needed stability in the country’s foreign exchange reserves. Owing to that, Pakistani rupee got vital support versus the greenback.
According to SBP’s data, the domestic currency inched up 0.08%, or Rs0.22, and closed at Rs285.17 against the dollar.
Market talk revealed that the currency had briefly recovered to Rs284.72/$ at a point in time, but closed comparatively lower around Rs285/$.
The rupee has hovered around that level for almost two weeks now. Thursday was the third consecutive working day for the uptick in the currency.
Market players observed some political instability associated with the upcoming general elections scheduled for February 2024.

In the open market, the rupee regained 0.17%, or Rs0.50, and settled at Rs286.50 against the greenback, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.
The currency also remained stable as foreign corporate investors returned to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), who made cumulative net buying of $15 million in the past four successive sessions, an investment that was witnessed after quite a long time.
In the entire month of November, they injected a net $31 million into the PSX, lending critical support to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and stabilising the rupee.
A slight drop in cut-off yields of government’s T-bills ranging from five to seven basis points in addition to the earlier decline also indirectly boosted the confidence of importers in the currency.
