0,Finance ministry to oversee four SOEs,"Alvi inks ordinances to make NHA, PNSC, state-run radio and postal services independent","The National Highway Authority (NHA), Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC), Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Post will now function under independent boards – as the caretaker government kicked off a process to meet another condition set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of the next tranche of $700 million to the country under the $3 billion stand-by arrangement.
President Dr Arif Alvi has given the nod to the ordinances related to the four non-profitable and loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – making them independent but under the finance ministry's oversight. On the advice of the interim premier, the president signed the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Ordinance, 2023; NHA Amendment Ordinance, 2023; Pakistan Postal Services Management Board Amendment Ordinance, 2023; and Pakistan National Shipping Corporation Amendment Ordinance, 2023.
According to the sources, the framework for changing the administrative structure of the four institutions has also been prepared.
They will now operate under the management of independent boards each comprising of six to 12 members. According to the sources, Pakistan Television Corporation, Pakistan Customs and Pakistan Steel Mills will also be made independent institutions in the second phase.

The interim law ministry will introduce ordinances for this purpose soon. In August this year, the IMF representative in Pakistan said the reform process to which the government had agreed required the country to keep all SOEs under the finance ministry's oversight.
“Following through on the previously agreed 2021 triage reform process, and other governance and private sector reforms, is important to durably attract foreign investment,” IMF’s Esther Perez Ruiz said in a statement to Reuters. According to a statement issued by the Press Information Department, the secretaries of all the relevant ministries informed the president of the urgent need for these ordinances as the matter was settled with the IMF in July this year in connection with these four SOEs.
The president has signed the ordinances to comply with the State-Owned Enterprises (Governance and Operations) Act, 2023 enacted in January this year. The law was enacted to improve the governance and operations of SOEs for enhancing the quality of service delivery and to bring about fiscal discipline.
“The government is now in the process of extending the provisions of the SOE law to such entities that are governed by special statutes. This will make their operations efficient and transparent,” the statement added. It further read that these amendments were part of the SOE reforms agreed by the Pakistani government with its international partners and included in the standby agreement with the IMF as a structural benchmark.

The statement read that through the new amendments, the offices of the chairman of the board and the chief executive would be separated in these entities to ensure good governance in line with international best practices. It continued that independent members would be inducted in the boards of the entities, adding fresh ideas and expertise in the decision-making process.
The security of the tenure of independent members would also be ensured.
The amendments would also ensure applicability of other provisions of the SOE Act, for example regular reporting of an entity’s performance to the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU). The CMU has been established in the finance ministry for monitoring the performance of the SOEs; preparation of annual business plans; and preparation and public disclosure of their reports to better inform the public about them.
According to the statement, the measures will increase the transparency, efficiency and oversight of these entities. The CMU will regularly report the performance of the entities to the Cabinet Committee on SOEs, thereby ensuring much needed visibility of their strengths and weaknesses to the highest forums within the federal government.
“Overall, the amendments in the laws of these state-owned entities will lead to better governance, service delivery and accountability to the public,” the statement concluded.

1,ECP notifies final list of constituencies,Magic number to become PM slips to 169 from 172,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday released the final list of constituencies completed under the fresh delimitation based on the 7th Population and Housing Census 2023, in which the general seats in the National Assembly had been decreased from 272 to 266.
According to the notification, the magic figure for becoming the new prime minister/leader of the house in the National Assembly has become 169 instead of 172. Under the new digital census, the ECP had reduced the representation of the newly merged districts in K-P from 12 to six.
In 2018, the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas was merged with K-P under the 25th Constitutional Amendment and initially 12 National Assembly seats were allocated to those districts for one time, which had now been reduced to six.
Hence, K-P’s strength in the National Assembly comes down to 45 from 51 in 2018. However, Punjab retained its 141 National Assembly seats; Sindh 51, Balochistan 16 and Islamabad three.

The general elections, which were supposed to be held on Nov 7 after the after the National Assembly was dissolved three days before the end of its constitutional term, were delayed as most political parties, particularly of Karachi, cried foul over the results of the new digital census, which had started on March 1 and ended in May.
It showed that Karachi's population had supposedly dropped by 15%. The population of Pakistan's largest city was still down about 1% from the last census in 2017, at 15.85 million. Several political parties, including the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), objected to the headcount, while concerns were also raised over the results in the most backward Balochistan province.
Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) spokesperson Zahid Askari had estimated that the city's actual population was probably more than 30 million, although there was no hard data to support this. The digital census was then re-conducted in September and the final results were released.

The ECP stated that the number of general seats in the Punjab Assembly remained unchanged at 297, Sindh Assembly also remained unchanged at 130, as well as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly 115 and Balochistan 51. According to the notification, the representation of Khairpur, Sanghar and Thatta districts in the Sindh Assembly has been reduced by one seat each.
It stated that Khairpur’s seats in the Sindh Assembly reduced from seven to six, the seats of Sanghar in the Sindh Assembly decreased from six to five and those of Thatta from three to two, while one seat each of Malir, Karachi East, and Karachi Central was increased.
Malir’s seats in the Sindh Assembly increased from five to six, Karachi East seats from eight to nine, and Karachi Central’s also from eight to nine.
In the new constituencies of the ECP, the seats of the National Assembly of Sindh have been changed. One seat in the National Assembly has increased. The seats in the National Assembly of Karachi South have increased from two to three.

2,Bilawal scoffs at Nawaz's fourth shot at power,PPP chairman claims Balochistan 'clearly signalled' backing PPP,"PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday asserted that the people of Balochistan had clearly signalled their support for his party while taking a dig at PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif's fourth shot at power. Addressing the Balochistan High Court Bar Association here, Bilawal remarked, ""We are constantly reminded that the three-time prime minister will address the issues faced by Pakistan today.""
Criticising both PTI Chairman Imran Khan and Nawaz, the PPP chairman urged the people not to hand over the fate of the country to the two leaders whose politics of hatred, division, and ignoring major issues had lessened the “value of the people’s blood”. Without explicitly mentioning former premier Nawaz, he scoffed at the notion of a return to power for the three-time prime minister.

“We are being told that the three-time prime minister will resolve the country's issues by assuming office for the fourth time.” Likewise, another person, Bilawal alluded, who faced difficulties during his tenure, was being portrayed negatively. “We must move beyond focusing on individuals.”
However, the former foreign minister emphasised that the fate of the country rested with its people, especially those in Balochistan. “The province is the heart of Pakistan,” he reaffirmed, quoting his father Asif Ali Zardari. He stressed that decisions affecting the country should be made by its citizens, expressing confidence that when the people of Pakistan made a collective decision, no global power could impede them.
“پاکستان کے عوام جب جاگ جاتے ہیں تو پھر دنیا کی کوئی طاقت انکا راستہ روک نہیں سکتی، کچھ لوگ سمجھتے ہیں کہ انہوں نے آپ کا فیصلہ لے لیا ہے مگر میری آپ سے درخواست ہے کہ آپ ان سب کو 8 فروری کو سرپرائیز دیں۔”

Bilawal asserted, “We trust the people of Pakistan; we are certain that you will heed our call. When we come to power, we aim to create a new history by departing from traditional thinking, outdated politics, and governance. Our focus should be on the people's interests.”
He added that it was essential to involve the people in the economy, society, and politics. “The PPP, standing at the forefront, pledges to address the concerns and rights of the people of Balochistan.” Bilawal emphasised the importance of federalism, encouraging a departure from the mistakes of the past.
Earlier, the PPP chairman held a series of meetings with members of the legal fraternity, party workers, and leaders during his two-day stay in the provincial capital.

3,"NAB files £190m reference against Imran, Bushra","Corruption case submitted in accountability court names eight accused, 59 witnesses","The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Friday filed a £190 million corruption reference against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, a close family friend Farah Gogi and others in the accountability court.
NAB Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi and Investigation Officer Mian Umar Nadeem submitted the reference against eight accused to the court’s Registrar's Office. The reference lists other accused as Shahzad Akbar, Barrister Ziaul Mustafa Naseem, and Zulfi Bukhari. Documents submitted include arrest warrants for the accused and a witness list comprising 59 individuals.
The reference accused the PTI chief and Akbar of collusion. It said that Akbar produced a misleading note on Dec 2, 2019 to show the account of the Supreme Court Registrar as the account of the state of Pakistan. It said that the PTI chairman, who was the prime minister at the time, was aware of the whole plan, as he had taken 458-kanal of land in 2019 that was transferred in the name of Zulfi Bukhari.

It added that when the land was given, the Al-Qadir Trust did not exist. In the reference, NAB had requested that the accused be tried and punished. The Registrar's Office started examining the reference, after which it would be presented before the Accountability Court Judge Muhammad Bashir.
Meanwhile, the Special Court, established under Official Secrets Act (OSA), on Friday signalled to conclude the cipher case trial against the PTI chairman and Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi within four weeks following the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) instructions.
The court had fixed the next hearing of the case in Adiala Jail on Saturday (today) after it received the law ministry’s notification. However, the PTI chairman had challenged the order of Special Court Judge Abual Hasnat Zulqarnain for the jail trial.
In the petition, Imran said that Judge Zulqarnain on Nov 23, 2023 ordered for the production of the accused in the court at the Federal Judicial Complex on Nov 28. However, the authorities did not present him for the hearing and the judge ordered a jail trial on. He said that in the presence of the order of Nov 23, the judge’s order of Nov 28 was illegal.
The petitioner requested the court to implement the Special Court judge’s order issued on Nov 23 for producing the accused at the FJC.

Meanwhile, according to the written order issued after the hearing of the cipher case on Friday, the accused, Imran and Qureshi, were not produced in the court. The court noted that the IHC has directed for completing the trial in four weeks.
At the outset of the hearing at the FJC, the court still awaited the law ministry’s notification. Judge Zulqarnain said that if the notification was not received, he would issue the production orders of the accused. However, the notification was submitted after a break.
The special prosecutor favoured the next hearing in Adiala Jail on Dec 2. However, Qureshi’s lawyer Ali Bukhari opined that it would be difficult for him to come on Saturdays because of the hearings in other trial courts. However, the judge ordered the next hearing of the case on Saturday (today).

4,Kabul gives ‘certain assurances’ on TTP,FO spokesperson says global network of Indian intelligence is involved in extra-territorial killings,"The Afghan Taliban government had given “certain assurances” to neutralise the threat of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Foreign Office said here on Friday, following Islamabad’s latest demands, seeking a decisive action against terrorist sanctuaries.
“We are obviously very disappointed that we have not seen the kind of results that we have expected from the Afghan authorities,” spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told reporters at her weekly news briefing. However, despite Pakistan’s disappointment, she emphasised that the “channels of communication” should continue.
“We will continue to impress on Afghan authorities to take effective action against these terrorist groups,” Baloch said.
“We have been given certain assurances with reference to our demands of the Afghan authorities. We now like to see effective action against these groups and substantial results on the ground with respect to any action that has been or is being taken against these terror outfits,” she added.

Earlier this week, Pakistan conveyed a list of demands, including the handing over of Hafiz Gul Bahadur, whose group claimed responsibility for the Nov 26 suicide attack in Bannu. Authorities said the attack was carried out by an Afghan national, the latest in a series of attacks Pakistan had seen since the return of Afghan Taliban to power in Aug 2021.
“These are ongoing conversations and I would not like to divulge all the details which are still being discussed between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the spokesperson replied, when asked to provide further details about the list of demands.
“However, our position has been clear that there should be effective, meaningful action against these terrorist groups and we should see concrete results of the action that Afghanistan takes against these terrorist groups,” she added.

Foiled assassination plot ​​​​​
On reports about the US foiling a plot by the Indian intelligence agencies to kill a Sikh leader on American soil, the spokesperson said these revelations were the latest in a series of such reports that confirmed the existence of a global network of Indian intelligence that was involved in espionage and extra-territorial killings.
“This network has been engaged in assassinations and abductions in South Asia for decades and Pakistan has remained a target of India’s state-sponsored terrorism, subversion, and espionage,” she added. “We have been inviting international attention to these activities of Indian intelligence services.”
Last year, Pakistan released a dossier with credible information about Indian involvement in the Lahore attack, she said. “We condemn these acts and believe that India’s irresponsible and reckless conduct is a clear violation of international law and the UN principle of state sovereignty.”
