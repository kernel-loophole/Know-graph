1,Balochistan grapples with right-to-know delays,Seminar speakers fervently call for establishment of information commission,"During a seminar conducted by the Center for Peace and Development Initiative (CPDI), a diverse group comprising members of Information Commissions, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), media, academia, and government officials collectively emphasized the urgent need for the implementation of the Balochistan Right to Information Act 2021 and the establishment of the Balochistan Information Commission.
This concerted effort represents a significant stride towards fostering transparency and accountability in governance. Mukhtar Ahmad Ali, the Executive Director of CPDI, underscored a critical point – although the act mandates the establishment of the commission within 120 days, three years have passed without its appointment. 
Despite citizens retaining the right to information, the absence of the commission compels individuals to seek information through the courts when not provided, highlighting the pressing need for the prompt establishment of the commission to streamline the right-to-information process.
In his opening remarks, Shoaib Ahmad Siddiqui, Chief Information Commissioner of the Pakistan Information Commission, emphasized the importance of the RTI Act as a sunshine law, essential for transparency and accountability. While acknowledging the enactment of the Balochistan RTI Act 2021, Siddiqui stressed that its efficacy hinges on the expeditious formation of the Balochistan Information Commission.

The session evaluated the implementation status of the directives issued in the previous meeting and assessed the overall progress on the computerization and digitization of land records across the province.
Key attendees included Caretaker Minister for Revenue and Finance, Ahmed Rasool Bangash, Caretaker Minister for Science, Technology & Information Technology (ST&IT), Dr. Najeeb Ullah, Senior Member Board of Revenue Ikramullah Khan, and other relevant authorities.
The meeting highlighted that following the chief minister’s intervention due to the sluggish progress of the land record computerization project, there has been a notable enhancement in the digitization process.

Over the past week, an additional 30 mauzas have become operational across various districts, increasing the total number from 2,356 to 2,386. Simultaneously, the count of manual mauzas has reduced from 813 to 474 within the same timeframe. Notably, in the past 11 days, 31 mauzas have been brought online, including 10 in Bannu, six in Abbottabad, seven in Charsadda, three in Peshawar, three in Kohat, and one each in Swat and Shangla.
However, during this period, 261 mauzas have been earmarked for the cessation of manual mutations, with 15 in Haripur, 10 in Swat, 11 in Shangla, 44 in Bannu, 15 in Peshawar, 159 in DI Khan, and seven in Battagram.
Addressing concerns about record rooms previously set ablaze, the caretaker chief minister ordered an inquiry against implicated officials, emphasizing a zero-tolerance stance on malpractices.
He asserted that stringent legal actions would be taken against any elements involved in wrongdoing. Emphasizing the significance of land records computerization, he stated that it is a pivotal goal for the caretaker provincial government, aiming to alleviate public challenges once fully implemented.
To expedite the land records computerization, deputy commissioners across all districts have been set realistic targets. The introduction of the “Land Records Computerization Tracking System” on the PMRU portal facilitates daily progress monitoring.
