0,Bureaucrats occupy college accommodations,"Conniving administration has allotted quarters, houses reserved for teaching staff and visitors to non-faculty persons","College premises, the world over, are inherently exclusive in nature as their academic and accommodation facilities are solely reserved for students, faculty, staff or foreign visitors however, for many government colleges in Sindh, the universal rule does not seem to apply, as several educational institutions turn into residential areas for high ranking state officials.
According to sources privy to The Express Tribune, some bureaucrats and officers from the College Education Department Government of Sindh have been unlawfully residing in quarters and residences located within the premises of at least three government colleges in Karachi namely the Government College of Physical Education Karachi, Government College of Education and the Khatun-e-Pakistan College.
“Many male officers have taken up residence in the Khatun-e-Pakistan College, which is dedicated to women only,” confirmed Professor Farida, Acting Principal at the Khatun-e-Pakistan College, who assured that a staff meeting had been organized by the Sindh Education Minister to investigate the matter.
In his defense, Sulaiman Sial, Regional Director of Managing Authority of Government Colleges of Karachi, who is also one of the officers taking residence at the Khatun-e-Pakistan College, denied the allegations that living within the college was impermissible.

“The former Secretary of the College Education Department had allotted these accommodations to me and the Deputy Director. Afterwards, the house rent was deducted from our salaries,” exclaimed Sial, who believed that the residence within the college was built for teachers and officers. However, upon being quizzed on whether he was a part of the faculty of the same college in which he had taken residence, Sial did not seem to have an answer.
Meanwhile, despite confirmation from the Regional Director, the Deputy Director of the College Education Department, Rashid Khoso denied the news circulating about him taking up residence in the Khatun-e-Pakistan College.
“I live in my own house with my family. I do not have any accommodation in the girl’s college,” maintained Khoso.
Where the residence of male officials in girls colleges compromises parietal rules, the occupation of accommodation spaces in other government colleges dedicated for visiting faculty, disturbs the logistics of the universities.
“We have come to know that several non-teaching persons are living in the college quarters at the Government College of Education despite not having any reasonable connection with the institution,” revealed Professor Naveed Rab, Principal at the College of Education. Other sources from within the same college reveal that some non-teaching persons staying inside the college premises at the Federal B area were not paying any rent either.

Similarly, sources also confirmed the residence of the former Regional Director of Colleges Karachi Professor Hafiz Bari among other officers at the Government College of Physical Education Karachi located in Gulistan-e-Johar, inspite of the fact that the accommodation rooms in the college were reserved for visitors from other regions who were visiting the campus for various educational activities.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Professor Hafiz Bari too denied the allegations, claiming instead that he was residing at a flat at Gurumandir.
In light of the claims made by several officials confirming the residence of non-teaching persons in colleges, the College Education Department is now considering gathering data of those individuals, who have been allotted quarters or are living inside houses located within government colleges. The data will be collected through a survey, after which appropriate action against the perpetrators will be taken.

1,Four-day Urdu Conference kicks off,"Literature can bring people of different backgrounds, cultures, and ways of life together, says CM","Sindh Chief Minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar has said that the International Urdu Conference being organised by the Arts Council for the last 16 years has now become our `literary brand' to spread the message of love, respect and tolerance.
This he said while speaking at the inauguration of 16th International Urdu Conference at the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi. 
The CM said, ""Literature can bring people of different backgrounds, cultures, and ways of life together. When people relate to a piece of literature, it makes you think that you're not alone and that someone else has been through what you are going through.""

Quoting Shakespeare, he said that literature is the expression of life in words of truth and beauty; it is the written record of man's spirit, of his thoughts, emotions, and aspirations; it is the history, and the only history, of the human soul. 
Justice Baqar appreciated the leading literary figures who contributed to the conferences through their literary work and developed a spirit of tolerance and co-existence among the people of different languages, religions and faiths.
The CM urged the youth not only to participate in such conferences which were bound to inculcate the spirit of humanity among them but also develop a habit of reading books. He urged the leading literary figures to play their role in making Pakistan a peaceful and tolerant society.

2,Encroachment removal deadline set,Bench stresses need for immediate operations to eliminate encroachments,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has directed the Sindh government to clear encroachments along the Superhighway from Sohrab Goth to Toll Plaza within a week. 
The decision was given by a two-member bench, headed by Justice Nadeem Akhtar, while hearing a petition raising concerns at illegal constructions and encroachments in the area. The bench also expressed frustration over the government’s failure to comply with the previous court orders to remove the encroachments.
The bench stressed the need for immediate operations to eliminate encroachments around Al-Asif Square as a priority. Justice Akhtar directed the agencies, including FWO, NHA, Rangers, Police, and others, to collaborate with the administration for this purpose. The court warned these institutions of potential consequences if the court order is not implemented.

Justice Akhtar highlighted the alarming situation on the M9 Motorway, where all lanes, except for two, have been occupied. The court expressed disappointment over the encroachment on the green belt and service roads, stressing that such disregard for responsibility undermines the court orders.
The additional advocate general informed the court about the chief secretary’s formation of a high-level committee. Justice Akhtar criticised the frequent formation of committees, urging the government to declare its intent to remove encroachments. He stated that the court would take appropriate action once the government’s intentions were clear.
The court questioned the deputy commissioner for District East about the time required for encroachment elimination. The DC stated a week is needed. 
The court issued a specific order to restore the roads and green belts of Sohrab Goth, Al-Asif Square, and the Superhighway according to the original master plan. The AAG suggested that erecting fences along the Superhighway would prevent reoccupation. Justice Akhtar approved the idea, reiterating the court’s order for the provincial government to remove encroachments on the Superhighway within a week.

The CM and the visiting World Bank regional chief discussed other factors to reduce stunting. They agreed to adopt a revised theory of change that includes all the critical drivers of stunting from ‘nutrition-specific’ to include the critical environmental factors that drive a large part of the biological process underlying stunting. These include, in particular, access to safe water besides sanitation and the safe management of animal and solid waste.

4,Work at 3 education boards halts,Minister sends home heads of BIEK and SBTE on November 23,"Office affairs are at a halt in at least three education boards of Sindh due to apparent mismanagement of the caretaker government.
The disbursement of salaries and preparation for examinations in these education boards have also stopped due to the abrupt transfers of top officers.
Enrollment and registration of new students and other issues are also suspended.
The interim education minister sent home the heads of Board of Intermediate Education Karachi (BIEK) and Sindh Board of Technical Education (SBTE) on November 23. Moreover, the secretaries, controller examinations and audit officers of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Benazirabad (Nawabshah) (BISEB) were also removed.

Subsequently, the office affairs in these education boards have come to a standstill. At BIEK, the work on examination results of all the faculties of the grade IX was almost at a standstill. Due to the lack of policy, the preparation of exam results has become slow. BISEB has yet to release the Diploma of Associate Engineer (DAE) first year results.
Since chairman, secretary and audit officers are not appointed, salaries have not been sent to the employees’ accounts. Due to non-payment of salaries, contract, daily wages and lower grade employees are suffering from severe mental stress. Salaries are normally transferred to employees’ accounts on the last date of every month.
According to an employee of the Technical Board, there are no funds available. The Express Tribune contacted Chief Minister Sindh’s spokesperson Rashid Channa in this regard, but he did not give any response.
