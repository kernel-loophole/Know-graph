2,PTI’s Avenfield dilemma,Party struggles to digest arch-foe Nawaz’s acquittal,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is grappling with disbelief after the acquittal of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) leader Nawaz Sharif in the Avenfield reference. While the PTI denounces the court’s decision as a “death knell to the justice system,” it continues to label Sharif a “certified criminal.”
The Islamabad High Court's exoneration of Nawaz Sharif, nearly six years after his initial trial, has provoked a strong response from the PTI. The party, which once based its narrative on opponents’ convictions, now contends with the stark reality of the court's decision contradicting its long-standing accusations.
Having built its narrative on branding Sharif as a “thief, dacoit, corrupt, and traitor,” the PTI now faces the challenge of reconciling its past reliance on court judgments with the current acquittal.
“It’s difficult for PTI to accept Nawaz Sharif’s acquittal from a corruption case as its whole narrative was built on this very thing,” eminent political expert, Zaigham Khan said and added, “for the PTI, everyone excluding Imran Khan is corrupt; how can it go against what was an integral part of the Tabdeli [change] project.”
Zaigham said that the PTI’s predicament underscores the complexities of political narratives grounded in legal outcomes, as the party now confronts the unexpected outcome that challenges its foundational anti-Nawaz and anti-PMLN stance. Back then, he recalled, the state machinery was pushing corruption narrative against certain individuals just like it is doing against some others right now.
Commenting on the judiciary’s role, Zaigham said that courts or the justice system was easily used to manage politics, saying several judges were on board back then who interpreted things as they wanted and didn’t even hesitate to create new jurisprudence. The subordinate judiciary, he lamented, followed what had already been decided by the superior judiciary. “It’s highly unfortunate but the judicial process was used for pushing narrative,” he noted.
Professor Tahir Naeem Malik of NUML University said that the PTI finds it difficult to accept the IHC’s decision as it contradicts its whole narrative against Nawaz and PML-N.
Also, the professor added, the PTI is unable to fathom the decision because the general elections are just around the corner and its voters won’t buy the anti-corruption narrative as the previous one has just fallen flat. “Acquittal is the end result of the politically-motivated cases,” Professor Malik said, adding political parties in Pakistan, unfortunately, do not believe in exposing the system as they simply prefer to go after individuals as long as it suits them.
On the judiciary’s role, Malik said that the country, where people have almost no trust on the justice system, puts a big mark on it. He recalled that the PTI had even taken credit for courts’ decision but it is not ready to accept reality now.
On Thursday, the PTI declared that the acquittal of “certified criminal” Nawaz Sharif in Avenfield Apartments reference under the “notorious London secret deal” by placing law and justice in the rear view mirror is a death knell to legal and justice system of the country as he had no proof to prove his innocence in the mega corruption case.
Strongly reacting to the IHC’s decision, PTI spokesperson said that the major relief granted to the “crooked person under a secret deal” was akin to murder of the law and justice system.
In a statement, he noted that the “criminal process of acquitting national criminals” one after another was continued with lightning speed by destroying the country’s institutions and judicial system altogether.
Contrary to the court’s ruling, PTI spokesperson recalled that “the tale of Nawaz Sharif’s ceaseless corruption exposed in the Panama Papers was still fresh in the minds of the nation”. He pointed out that “the saga from fabricated Qatari letter, Calibri font and other evidences like fake trust deeds were enough to prove Nawaz as guilty in Avenfield reference”.
The PTI spokesperson said that a person, who raised the slogan ""Respect the vote"", was being given major relief through “third NRO, which was a very humiliating and a matter of great concern for the judicial system”.

3,PML-N may appoint youth coordinators at UC level,Maryam discusses preparations for elections with youth coordinators,"The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has held consultations for the appointment of youth coordinators up to the level of Union Council in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and discussed organisational matters and preparations for general elections.
PML-N Senior Vice President and Chief Organiser met with the K-P youth coordinators on Thursday. Maryam said, “Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa needs Pakistan Muslim League the most. It has been made a kangal (penniless) province.
“In 10 years, the worst corruption and looting continued in K-P in the name of BRT and Billion Tree Tsunami.” The PML-N chief organiser said, “Three-and-a-half-hundred dams could not be built in 10 years, but the nation was made a dam fool step by step.”
She claimed that a hospital, a college, and a university could not be built in 10 years. There was a change in 10 years in the province, she said, and the change was that the province did not have money to pay salaries and pensions.

Like Pakistan, she said, they – referring to the PTI – put the biggest debt in the history on K-P. She also claimed that unwanted change let Pakistan and K-P on the brink of default.
Maryam said that the first health card was given to K-P in the whole of Pakistan by Nawaz Sharif. On Jan 1, 2016, the then Prime Minister Nawaz launched the health card.
Those who looted £ 190 million have usurped the resources of K-P and Pakistan. Maryam said, “We will remove 10 years of deprivation of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and build the most modern hospitals and the best educational institutions in the province.”
The youth coordinators thanked Maryam for encouraging the workers.

4,Body formed to check ‘bias’ in olive plants’ import,Move comes after Senate panel informed ‘single firm’ receiving tenders for import for five years,"Caretaker Interior Minister Senator Sarfraz Bugti on Thursday formed a subcommittee to investigate into the matter of a single company being awarded tenders for the import of olive plants for the past five years within two months and present its findings.
The move came after a Senate panel was informed about the matter. JUI-P Senator Kamran Murtaza will head the subcommittee. The Senate Standing Committee on National Food Security and Research held a meeting at the Parliament House presided over by its chairman, PML-F Senator Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah.
The meeting started with a comprehensive discussion on the unavailability of fertilisers for the farmers in Sindh. The committee was informed about the numerous complaints received from farmers across the country, highlighting its dire consequences of creating a shortage of wheat crop in Sindh.
It was pointed out that the black market price had soared to Rs5,600 per 50kg bag, significantly higher than the regulated rate of Rs3,560. The committee directed the ministry to urgently collaborate with the stakeholders to resolve this critical issue.
The Senate panel expressed its concerns over the non-receipt of cotton cess from textile firms for the past five years. It highlighted its negative impact on the research of the crop and delay in payments to Pakistan Central Cotton Committee (PCCC) employees.

With arrears of over Rs3 billion, the committee directed officials of the ministry to liaise with the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA), address these concerns and facilitate the collection of cotton cess. The Senate panel was informed that the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) had developed two new varieties of wheat.
The chairman of the panel recommended compiling a list of progressive farmers for better access to them. He also suggested a monthly newsletter to inform farmers about agricultural developments. The committee advised the PARC to contact the farmers' associations of Sindh and Punjab. It also sought a report from the PCCC on the new varieties of cotton and their availability in the market.
Senators Sania Nishtar, Seemee Ezdi and Jam Mahtab Hussain Dahar; caretaker National Food Security and Research Minister Dr Kausar Abdullah Malik; and officials of the PARC and PCCC were among those who attended the huddle. A day earlier, the caretaker national food security and research minister directed the PARC to form a body for the permanent recruitment of scientific staff.
He also stressed the need for chalking out a plan in accordance with the rules and regulations for the people in the scientific domain so they were offered opportunities in their own homeland instead of serving abroad.

5,Aleema says anyone’s audio clip can be leaked next,Urges all to condemn such breaches as intruding into people's homes is unacceptable,"Aleema Khanum, the sister of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, has cautioned those who leaked an audio clip, purportedly featuring Bushra Bibi and former PM’s lawyer Latif Khosa, to be mindful of their own business, expressing concern that anyone's audio could be leaked at any given moment.
In the audio clip, Bushra and Khosa could be heard discussing their grievances against Imran's sisters.
The former first lady recalled a recent incident when Imran's sisters raised concerns about the handling of a case related to the PTI chief's safety in Attock jail.
She went on to say that the presence of the sisters created complications. ""Tomorrow, it could be anyone's audio leaking... we should worry about our homes as well,” Aleema said while talking to the media outside the Federal Judicial Complex on Friday.

She said that even the US president was declared ineligible as no one was allowed to breach anyone’s privacy ""Our sense of shame and decency is eroding. Intruding into people's homes is unacceptable, and we must collectively condemn such breaches,” she added.
“First, they tarnished the sanctity of women by breaking the code of chadar and chaar deewari. What will they do next … drag women out in the open for public spectacle,” she questioned. Imran’s sister said that even an audio clip of the mother-in-law of a former chief justice was leaked. “We might be listening to your wife’s [audio clip] next,” she concluded.

6,ECP may hold Imran’s contempt trial in jail,Commission mentions interior ministry’s report citing security concerns,"A tribunal of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday gave the indication that PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan’s trial in a contempt case could take place inside Adiala Jail – where he is currently detained – mentioning the findings of an interior ministry report that cited security concerns.
During the hearing, ECP Sindh member Nasir Durrani told the PTI chief’s lawyer Shoaib Shaheen that the interior ministry had submitted a report, which read that Imran could not be presented before any court or tribunal.
He added that the ministry had suggested that the ECP should send a team to the prison to frame charges against the former premier.
However, Durrani continued that the commission had yet to decide the matter.
The PTI chairman’s lawyer told the tribunal he had not been provided with a copy of the last hearing’s order.
He continued that he had also not been provided with a copy of the interior ministry’s report despite the submission of an application.
He asked the tribunal to provide him with a copy of the ministry’s report if it was a “routine” one.
The ECP Sindh member assured the lawyer that he would be provided with a copy of the ministry’s report. He added that the report proposed that the ECP should visit the jail to indict the PTI chief.
Shaheen replied that the jail trial of a leader of a popular political party would create a negative impression among the people.
Durrani told him not to worry about these matters and let the commission perform its duty in accordance with the law.
He added that the PTI’s legal team wants to push the case forward but at the same time, not cooperating with the ECP tribunal.
The PTI chief’s lawyer claimed that his client was deliberately not being presented before the tribunal.
ECP Balochistan member Shah Muhammad Jatoi told him that the PTI was intentionally not producing its chief before the ECP earlier.
He added that why should the ECP risk summoning Imran before the tribunal.
Jatoi maintained that the commission would focus on the law and not the accused.
Asad Umar also appeared before the ECP tribunal in the same case. To the tribunal’s query, Umar replied that he had appeared before the ECP the most.
Umar also told the ECP tribunal that he had quit politics. An ECP member told him that he could continue politics.
The former PTI leader said he was grateful to the ECP member but repeated that he had quit politics.
Later, Umar submitted his written response to the commission.
Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry did not appear before the tribunal.
Subsequently, the tribunal adjourned the hearing of the case till December 6.
Talking to the media after the proceedings, Shaheen complained that the PTI had not been provided with a copy of the interior ministry’s report.
He also raised questions about the transparency and fairness of the next general elections.
The PTI chief’s lawyer accused the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) of facilitating PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.
The proceedings of the PTI chief’s trial in the Toshakhana, cipher, and £190 million settlement case are already taking place inside the premises of Adiala Jail because of security concerns.
The ECP had initiated contempt proceedings against Imran, Umar and Fawad last year for issuing statements against the electoral body and the chief election commissioner.
