This is being done under the ‘Prosperous Pakhtunkhwa Program’ which involves taking multiple initiatives for the wellbeing and prosperity of people across the province.
This was claimed by K-P Caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retd) Syed Arshad Hussain Shah on Wednesday. He said that the government was trying its level best to introduce useful reforms in every sector to serve the masses.
The chief minister visited the Peshawar Press Club where he inaugurated a 25 KV solar system which has been installed at a cost of Rs6.4 million.
The newly installed solar system will save up to Rs2 million annually in electricity bills. K-P Caretaker Provincial Minister for Information Barrister Feroz Jamal Shah Kakakhel, Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry, Information Secretary Abdul Jabbar Shah and Information & PRs Director General Muhammad Imran were also present on the occasion.
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the solar system, the chief minister said that the province had to improve its governance system keeping in view the principles and requirements of public service delivery so as to effectively resolve the issues being faced by the general public at their door steps.
He remarked that the caretaker provincial government had already launched a comprehensive drive against all issues related to the general public including drugs, street crimes, adulteration, hoarding, self-imposed price hikes, vehicular traffic problems, encroachments and revenue-related issues.
However, he said, the government would also need the cooperation and guidance of the media in the operation against the menace of drugs, adding that drug peddlers had emerged as the most dangerous enemies of our younger generation as they had made even educational institutions their strongholds for that nefarious purpose. That is why, he said, the struggle against them would need to have the cooperation of all sections of society, especially journalists.
Touching upon other reform initiatives, the chief minister said that training programmes would be arranged for farmers through the agriculture and livestock departments in order to increase production, adding that the provincial government had provided public service delivery programmes to all ministries and departments the benefits of which would soon reach the people.

She stressed that the PPP was focused on strengthening democracy and combating poverty, unemployment, extremism, and the politics of division and hatred, adding that the videos of Nawaz Sharif disrespecting the traditional Balochi turban reflected his prejudiced and biased mentality.
Marri emphasized that the PPP had deep respect for the traditions and values of the people.
