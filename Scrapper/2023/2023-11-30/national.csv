0,IHC halts Rs35b tax on banks,"Suspends windfall tax decision, questions legality, powers of interim setup","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday suspended the government’s decision to impose a windfall income tax on commercial banks for the recovery of Rs35 billion, after lawyers questioned the powers of the interim setup and the constitutionality of the move.
The court’s decision came a day before the last date for the payment of an estimated Rs35 billion tax by those commercial banks that had manipulated the value of foreign currency to make extra profits.
Read: 40% tax on banks’ windfall profits
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was betting on the Rs35 billion in revenues to achieve its monthly target of nearly Rs711 billion. It is now left with the goal of collecting over Rs100 billion more today (Thursday) to meet the monthly target, although it may achieve the five-month tax collection target of Rs3.45 trillion.

“The submissions (by petitioners) demonstrate not only a prima facie case but also that the ingredients of balance of convenience and irreparable loss operate in favour of the petitioner. Resultantly, the operation of the impugned statutory regulatory order shall remain suspended till the next date of hearing,” reads the short order of the court.
Eight days ago, the FBR, through SRO 1588, had imposed a 40% windfall income tax on income from foreign exchange of banking companies for the preceding two years ended on December 31, 2021, and 2022.
Advocate Supreme Court, Salman Akram Raja, pleaded before the court on behalf of his banking clients.
While the government had anticipated banks to challenge the levy, the financial institutions were finding it difficult to hire lawyers to plead their case.
The government had issued the SRO under section 99D, which the Parliament had inserted into the law in June this year. While the FBR imposed taxes on the banks to get an additional Rs35 billion out of an estimated Rs90 billion windfall income, it conveniently ignored a windfall profit of approximately Rs1.5 trillion made by exporters. The Ministry of Finance has estimated that the exporters made a windfall gain of Rs1.5 trillion due to steep currency devaluation these past few years.
The banks’ lawyers argued that section 99D (through which the federal government could determine a tax rate between 0% and 40%) was tantamount to excessive delegation of power by Parliament and in breach of Article 77 of the Constitution.
The legal team also questioned the power of the caretaker government in imposing the tax, arguing that the function of the caretaker government was only to “attend to day-to-day affairs and (it) cannot extend its authority to a fresh taxation measure.”
The legal team also argued that the SRO was also defective in that the determination of the preconditions under section 99D, namely, the economic factors that led to the windfall income as well as the quantum of the windfall income, are conspicuous by their absence in the impugned SRO.
The team further argued that by reading the SRO, there was only an underlying (but invalidated) assumption that external economic factors have actually operated and led to a windfall income but without these being spelt out in the notification, which would be expected given the letter and spirit of section 99D.
The petitioners also claimed that the charge of additional tax conflicted with entry number 47 in the Legislative List for imposing an additional tax which was not warranted.
The law requires that the notification of the windfall tax has to be placed before the National Assembly within three months –a clause that the banks have now invoked as there is no assembly in Pakistan and the next elections are scheduled for February 8th.
The lawyer argued before the court that the government assumes that the next assembly will validate its action but it is quite possible that the National Assembly does not agree to bless the notification.
If the next assembly rejects the additional tax, banks would be at a disadvantageous position, according to the petitioners.
The court did not accept the arguments of the FBR legal counsel who submitted that the legislation has to remain operative until it is declared ultra vires. The court accepted the banks’ argument that the interim relief is sought in respect of the SRO, which is an executive act and not legislation and, therefore, prima facie not covered by the judgments on the point referred to by the counsel for the FBR.

1,Growers sound alarm on fertiliser crisis,Seek immediate intervention to tackle fertiliser black market during crucial wheat sowing season,"Growers in Sindh have appealed to the federal and provincial governments, as well as Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, to take notice and prompt action to curb hoarding, smuggling, counterfeiting, and the black market of Urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilisers in Sindh immediately; otherwise, food insecurity could ensue.
“After demanding action from the federal and provincial governments on multiple occasions, I had to write a letter [available with The Express Tribune] to the COAS to address the ineptitude of all three fertiliser companies: Fauji Fertiliser Company Limited, Engro Fertilisers Limited, and Fatima Fertiliser Company Limited. Additionally, three Sindh government departments, including Sindh Agriculture Extension, Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE), and Revenue, are being implicated in hoarding, smuggling, counterfeiting, and the black market of fertilisers due to nepotism, favouritism, and corruption. This is agonising farmers and driving up input costs of agricultural produce,” said Ali Palh, Advocate and President of the Small Growers’ Organisation Sindh Agriculture Research Council (SARC), speaking to The Express Tribune.
He highlighted that the government’s substantial subsidies to fertiliser companies have been in vain, as poor growers are not benefiting from them, leading to an acute shortage of fertilisers in the market. “We have laws, including the Sindh Fertiliser (Control) Act 1994 and Sindh Fertiliser (Control) Rules 1999; however, they are not being implemented to benefit peasants at all,” he emphasised.

Frustrated with the caretaker government, Jawaid Junejo, Chairman of the Farmer Organisations Council Sindh, expressed concern that large farmers are being compelled to purchase fertiliser sacks at almost double rates, while small growers are unable to obtain them, even at higher rates in the market. “We are running a social media trend; those who provide fertilisers at government rates to farmers will garner votes from the people in the upcoming general elections. This is the wheat sowing season, and we are being deprived of fertilisers,” he lamented.
Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA), Senior Vice President, Nabi Bux Sathio highlighted that instead of a controlled Urea price at Rs3,680 per 50kg bag, it is being sold for Rs5,000-5,500 per 50kg in the market. He pointed out that a 50kg sack of DAP, which was sold at Rs9,000 until October 30, is now being sold at Rs15,000 per 50kg bag due to wheat sowing and other Rabi season crops.
“A total of 6.5 million tonnes of Urea are being produced in the country, meeting a local demand of 6.2 million tonnes. We should have a surplus, but no action is being taken. Growers need Urea and DAP fertilisers for better yield, rapid growth of standing crops. I urged the Sindh Chief Minister during a meeting today (Wednesday) in Hyderabad to make the fertiliser portal, set up by the federal government under the Ministry of Industries and Production, public. This way, every farmer can obtain updated information about actual bags of fertilisers sent to authorised dealers in every district. I also proposed forming an agriculture advisory committee to monitor agriculture issues and fix problems through monthly meetings,” he concluded.

2,Saudi Arabia wins bid for 2030 world fair,Leaves Italian contestants scathing in their disappointment,"The Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh won the right to host the Expo 2030 world fair, vote results showed on Tuesday, in another diplomatic victory for a Gulf country after last year’s soccer World Cup in Qatar.
South Korea’s port city of Busan and Rome in Italy were also in the running to host the five-yearly event that attracts millions of visitors and billions of dollars in investment.
Riyadh won 119 votes, Busan 29 and Rome 17, results from 182 members of the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) showed. Saudi Arabia needed two-thirds of the votes to win from the first round.
The Italian contestants were scathing in their disappointment.
“This huge result for Saudi was unexpected in those proportions,” Giampiero Massolo, head of the Italian Expo bid, told reporters. “It is no longer about the merits, but about transactions. Yesterday it was a soccer championship, tomorrow it will be the Olympics,” he added.

However, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol congratulated Saudi Arabia for winning the bid, calling the Gulf state “a key partner,” and adding that his nation would share the resources and experience gained to help Riyadh hold a successful event.
Riyadh had enlisted soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for the Al-Nassr Saudi club, to convince members in a video projected before the vote. Riyadh aims to host the event between October 2030 and March 2031.
The win is the icing on the cake for de-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious Vision 2030 programme, which aims to wean the country off its oil dependency.

3,Crude edges up ahead of OPEC+ meet,Shrugs off US oil stockbuild on worries of extended supply cut,"Oil prices edged higher in volatile trading on Wednesday as investors focused their attention on an upcoming OPEC+ output policy meeting and looked past a jump in US crude, gasoline and distillate stockpiles.
Brent crude futures were up 43 cents, or 0.5%, to $82.11 a barrel by 1632 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 49 cents, or 0.6%, at $76.90 a barrel. Both benchmarks gained more than a dollar earlier in the session, briefly turned negative before the bearish weekly US inventory report was released, and then rebounded after.
“Prices are going to remain volatile until we get greater clarity out of OPEC,” Kpler analyst Matt Smith said.
Read: Oil rises over 2% with focus on OPEC+ cuts
Oil benchmarks rose about 2% on Tuesday as the market anticipated that OPEC+, made up of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, would extend or deepen supply cuts.
OPEC+ on Wednesday continued talks, which sources had described as difficult. A meeting to decide on next year’s output policy on Thursday was, however, expected to go ahead on schedule. “We expect Saudi Arabia to extend their 1 million bpd production cut with little other positive news from the meeting,” Smith said.

4,Further Rs3.5 per unit tariff hike in the offing,"If approved, consumers will be burdened with additional Rs40b","Electricity consumers should brace for another hefty tariff increase of up to Rs3.53 per unit on account of fuel charges adjustment (FCA).
In that regard, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) conducted a public hearing on Wednesday but reserved its judgement that would be issued after scrutiny of data.
If the entire impact of fuel price increase is passed on to consumers, they will bear an additional burden of Rs40 billion. Even the protected consumers using 200 units of electricity a month will see their monthly bills swell by Rs650-700 owing to the tariff hike.
During the hearing, the power-sector regulator was informed that FCA of Rs3.53 per unit was being sought for December 2023. The fuel adjustment paid in November was Rs0.40 per unit, therefore, the net increase for consumers would be Rs3.13 per unit.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guarantee (CPPA-G), on behalf of power distribution companies (DISCOs), also claimed previous adjustments of Rs28 billion. Of the total, China Power was claiming Rs3 billion while Thar Coal Block-1 was seeking Rs25 billion.
It was informed to the hearing that system constraints caused a total financial impact of Rs103.7 million as National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) could not be able to transmit electricity from some power plants.
Interveners, present at the hearing, chastised the regulator for putting an extra load on consumers from the previous fuel adjustments. They sought a logical opinion for making such old adjustments.
The interveners emphasised that the regulator was bound to pass on the increase in FCA to the consumers within a limited time frame. They called for informing the consumers about the timeline for recovering any hike in electricity tariffs.
Based on data provided to Nepra, the CPPA-G requested an increase of Rs3.5339 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in power tariff over reference fuel charges of Rs7.8938 per kWh determined by the authority for ex-Wapda DISCOs. However, the actual fuel cost came in at Rs11.4177 per unit during October.
In the month, hydroelectric power accounted for the largest share, constituting 32.54% of the total electricity generation, at 3,114 gigawatt hours (GWh).

Local coal-based electricity followed with a 13.94% share and average cost of Rs12.10 per kWh, along with imported coal contributing 3.51% at a cost of Rs13.26.
Gas-based generation made up 7.35% of the total, priced at an average of Rs13.6059 per kWh, while re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) generation made a substantial contribution of 20.25% with average cost of Rs23.6987 per kWh. Nuclear power also had a significant share at 19.08% of total generation, but at a remarkably low average cost of Rs1.2272 per kWh.
A marginal fraction, 0.24%, of electricity was imported from Iran at an average cost of Rs23.1678 per kWh. Wind, bagasse and solar-based energy collectively accounted for 3.09% of total generation.
Overall, with a total energy output of 9,572 GWh, the average cost stood at Rs8.2605 per kWh for October 2023, showcasing the dynamics of cost-varied energy landscape.
However, DISCOs were delivered a net 9,253 GWh at a cost of Rs11.4277 per unit against the reference fuel cost of Rs7.8938 per kWh, an increase of Rs3.5339.
Transmission losses were calculated at 2.93%, or 281 GWh, out of the total electricity generated in October.
Meanwhile, the NTDC management argued that the regulator had not allowed some adjustments amounting to Rs42 billion that resulted in financial implications for the company.
They said that they had only Rs3 billion and that too was taken away by the Federal Board of Revenue, cautioning that they did not have any money to pay pensions and salaries of employees.

5,"Despite initial spike, PSX undergoes correction","KSE-100 index loses 228.26 points, settles at 60,502","As Pakistan’s stock market broke record high levels one after another over the past couple of weeks, investors eventually took a pause and resorted to some profit-booking on Wednesday.
It came following World Bank Vice President for South Asia Martin Raiser’s remarks that Pakistan’s economy was stuck in a low-growth trap, citing that the culture of corruption, landlords and industrialists were resisting reforms. Consequently, the KSE-100 index experienced a correction of over 200 points.
Earlier, the market got off to a positive start with a sharp spike that took the index to its intra-day high at 61,555.83 points. However, selling pressure grew at that level, which wiped out all earlier gains and pulled the index to the intra-day low at 60,328.17 immediately after midday.
The index remained volatile with market players worried about the government’s decision to raise industrial gas tariffs amid a circular debt crisis.
“The market witnessed pressure after the World Bank cautioned about the economic crisis linked to deep-seated vested interests of the elite and political opportunism hindering foreign investment,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Government’s decision to raise industrial gas tariffs amid Rs4.5 trillion in energy sector circular debt, reports of dismal data on cement sales, concerns about unsustainable debt and painful domestic debt restructuring played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a modest loss of 228.26 points, or 0.38%, and settled at 60,502. Topline Securities, in its report, wrote that the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) underwent some correction, concluding the session at 60,502 with a decrease of 228 points.
“Initially, there was a positive start with a rally that propelled the index beyond the 61,000 mark for the first time. However, within an hour of trading, the emergence of selling pressure led to a reversal, erasing the earlier gains and taking the index in negative territory for the rest of the session,” it said.

The index showed significant volatility throughout the day. It reached an intra-day high of 61,555.84, marking an increase of 825.57 points, and a low of 60,328.18, reflecting a decline of 402.09 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed that the KSE-100 index closed in the red following eight consecutive days of gains on the back of selling pressure. It saw an intra-day high of 61,555 points, +1.36%.
Positive contributors were Millat Tractors (+2.61%), Pakistan Services (+3.91%) and Engro (+0.70%). In contrast, Habib Bank (-3.11%), Hub Power (-0.81%) and Meezan Bank (-1.62%) were the major drags, AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal said that the market opened on a positive note, but profit-taking by investors dragged it down. “Going forward, we recommend investors to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy in the cement, banking and E&P sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 692.2 million shares compared with Tuesday’s tally of 779.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs27.04 billion.
Shares of 387 companies were traded. Of these, 143 stocks closed higher, 231 dropped and 13 remained unchanged.
The Bank of Punjab was the volume leader with trading in 50.1 million shares, gaining Rs0.16 to close at Rs5.61. It was followed by Cnergyico PK with 35.7 million shares, staying unchanged at Rs4.60 and Pakistan Refinery with 35.4 million shares, losing Rs0.46 to close at Rs25.01. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs1.19 billion, according to the NCCPL.

7,"Gold surges to 3-month high at Rs221,000 per tola","Rupee remains stable at Rs285.39/$, increasing by 0.05%","The price of gold hit a three-month high at Rs221,000 per tola (11.66 grams) in Pakistan, following a global trend, as the domestic currency remains largely stable at around Rs285 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Wednesday.
With the latest increase of Rs2,600 per tola in the day, the precious metal has cumulatively increased by 2.45% or Rs5,300 in the past four consecutive working days to date, according to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency ticked up for the second successive working day by 0.05%, or Rs0.13, to close at Rs285.39 against the greenback.
The currency has been fluctuating near and around the currency level for the past around 10 days.
While talking to The Express Tribune, AA Gold Commodities, Director Adnan Agar said gold has hit a seven-month high at $2,047 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market. This provided the basis for the local bullion pricing body to revise up the rate to the recent high in the country.
He mentioned that the strong expectation for an interest rate cut by the US central bank – Federal Reserve – anytime between March and May 2024 has encouraged global investors to take new positions in the safe haven of gold in recent days. A similar situation exists in Pakistan where investors are anticipating a rate cut due to the expected slowdown in inflation in the near future.
The uptrend in the precious metal was also backed by a notable increase in the US quarterly GDP growth to 5.2%, surpassing the expectation of 4.5% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Other contributing factors include a drop in the international oil price, weakening of the US dollar against other major global currencies, and the Gaza truce expansion.
Read: Gold soars to one-month high
Agar said, “Gold may test a new all-time high near and around $2,100 per ounce in December ahead of Christmas buying and speculation for a US interest rate cut.”
International investors are relocating their savings into the safe haven of gold these days from fixed income instruments like US bonds, he said.
The metal hit a previous all-time high of $2,085 per ounce in April 2023, he recalled.
In the medium run, however, gold is expected to face a drastic drop in profit booking, as international stock markets are expected to attract investors in a couple of months when global inflation readings and US interest rates go down.
“People will sell gold to buy stocks, as gold does not pay dividends like stocks,” he said.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) President Malik Bostan said the rupee remains stable in the wake of the multibillion-dollar investment expectations over the next four to six months.
“The rupee will recover to its fair value of Rs250/$ when the strongly expected investment and multilateral inflows come into Pakistan,” he said.
The rupee will recover gradually in phases from the current Rs285/$ to Rs275/$, then to Rs265/$, and finally to Rs250/$, he said.

8,Rs70b money laundering uncovered,"FBR reveals two firms, with support from banks, funnelled funds abroad","Pakistan’s tax chief on Wednesday disclosed that two importers of solar panels were involved in a Rs70 billion money laundering scheme after an internal investigation revealed the involvement of five commercial banks in transferring funds to destinations like Switzerland and Singapore.
“It is trade-based money laundering,” said Amjad Zubair Tiwana, the Chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), while briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Finance on the alleged money laundering of Rs69.5 billion by two companies.
The money was transferred to countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates against imports from China, according to FBR investigations. Over Rs16.5 billion was laundered to the UAE and Singapore alone, as shown in the report. The FBR investigation further revealed that five well-known commercial banks were used for laundering money overseas through heavy cash transactions.
M/s Bright Star transferred Rs47 billion out of Pakistan against solar panel imports and did not file income tax returns. M/s Moonlight Traders transferred Rs23.7 billion overseas despite having a “very weak financial position.”
The FBR worked out the Rs69.5 billion figure based on the scrutiny of the data of 63 importers, although almost the entire amount was transferred by just two companies.
If the data of all the 450 importers is properly scrutinised, the quantum of money laundering would be anywhere between $2 billion to $2.5 billion during the past five years, said Senator Musaddaq Malik of the PML-N.
Malik said that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) played the role of a silent spectator during this period and was still not forthcoming in taking action against the banks involved in the money laundering.
“Commercial banks allowed the transfer of import remittances to third countries without any no objection certificate from the Chinese exporters in violation of foreign exchange regulations and SBP’s instructions,” showed the report submitted before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance by the FBR.
“Banks’ statements of M/s Bright Star and M/s Moonlight Traders reflect mutual transfers of funds and indicate a business association between the two suspected companies that transferred Rs70.7 billion out of Pakistan on the basis of duty and taxes-free import of solar panels,” according to the report.
Scrutiny of import data and income tax declarations of 39 importers reflected high disparity between financial worth and import values, according to the FBR report. It added, the worth of 39 importers was just Rs14.7 billion but they imported Rs201 billion worth of goods. Similarly, the scrutiny of bank accounts records of 44 importers showed that they deposited Rs47 billion in cash, which was equal to one-fourth of the total bank deposits of these branches.
In many cases, over Rs10 million was deposited in these accounts as cash transfers in a single transaction, bringing these accounts into the category of “high-risk suspected category for money laundering considerations.”

Between 2017 and 2022, there has been a massive increase in solar panel imports, accompanied by the emergence of shell and dummy companies exploiting duty and tax-free imports for illicit financial activities.
In October 2022, the FBR initiated an audit and picked 63 solar panel importers out of a total of 450 importers of Chinese origin solar panels, resulting in the identification of Rs69.5 billion money laundering. The money laundering was done through 6,232 import invoices through commercial banks, the committee was informed.
So far, the FBR has registered eight FIRs covering Rs41 billion worth against three Quetta-based dummy companies and two Peshawar-based companies. The FIRs have recently been lodged against M/s Bright Star Business Solution (Pvt) Ltd and M/s Moonlight Trader (SMC) Pvt Ltd.
The funds were transferred to a Dubai-based company, Ocular General Trading, against imports made from China, said Director Customs FBR, Sheeraz Ahmad.
The FBR’s investigation revealed that Bright Star Business, having a financial worth of a mere Rs10 million, imported Rs47 billion worth of solar panels and laundered Rs30.64 billion overseas through over invoicing.
Bright Start did not file income tax returns in 2018 but imported Rs5.4 billion panels. In 2019, the company imported Rs18.8 billion panels but declared Rs13.9 million incomes in the returns. In 2021, when Bright Start imported Rs16.9 billion panels, it did not file any return nor got the FBR activated against it. Similarly, in the tax year 2022, the company again imported Rs3.1 billion worth of panels but did not file the income tax returns.
MoonLight Traders, having a financial worth of a mere Rs101 million, imported Rs25.7 billion worth of goods and laundered Rs7.1 billion, according to the documents submitted before the Senate Panel.
The FIRs have been registered on charges of fiscal fraud and trade-based money laundering involving the exploitation of import transactions to transfer funds out of Pakistan through the use of unlawful activities, use of illicit cash, and illicit financial flows to Dubai, Singapore, Switzerland, and other countries.
The standing committee appreciated the findings of the FBR and grilled the SBP for its lack of support to the committee in the investigations. The central bank has been instructed to conduct a detailed review and inform the standing committee about the actions that it took against these commercial banks.
