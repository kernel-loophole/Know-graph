1,HRCP ‘appalled’ by killing of Mansehra girl,Commission highlights state's failure to rein in SC’s 2019 ruling that declares jirga unconstitutional,"The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) is “appalled” by the recent “honour” killing of a young girl in Mansehra.
The girl was allegedly killed by her family members after a video featuring her went viral on social media.
The fact that the murder was sanctioned by a local jirga in Kohistan is a harrowing reminder that violence against women remains deeply accepted in Pakistan, the HRCP said in a statement.

The commission noted that the state had failed to rein in antiquated means of so-called justice despite the Supreme Court's 2019 ruling that jirga decisions were illegal and unconstitutional.
Hailing the arrests of the perpetrator, suspected accomplices and three members of the Jirga, the HRCP urged the state to ensure that solid evidence was collected against the accused and no provision was left for blood money.
The commission demanded security for others featured in the video, including a girl who returned to her family and boys who had gone into hiding.

3,FBR freezes PIA’s bank accounts,Taxman takes action in view of non-payment Rs55b federal excise duty,"The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has frozen all of Pakistan International Airlines' (PIA) bank accounts due to non-payment of federal excise duty. This action has exacerbated the problems faced by the national flag carrier, which has been struggling with serious financial crises for several years.
According to FBR officials, PIA's liabilities exceed Rs55 billion in federal excise duty until September 2023. Despite repeated notices, PIA has failed to settle this duty. Additionally, their tax liabilities for October 2023 remain undetermined as tax returns for that month are yet to be filed.
All of PIA's bank accounts were frozen by the FBR's subsidiary organization, the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) in Karachi, to recover these tax liabilities. An amount of Rs1.5 billion has already been recovered and deposited into the national treasury. Instructions have been given to banks to immediately transfer any funds received in PIA's accounts to the FBR's treasury accounts.

Recent reports indicate that PIA has not filed returns since February of this year and is required to promptly pay Rs2.77 billion following a tribunal's order. This freezing of accounts occurred two days prior to the month's end, a departure from the usual practice of such actions taking place on the month's last day.
Last month, PIA had to cancel or delay numerous flights due to unpaid dues to the state's oil marketing company, Pakistan State Oil (PSO). A report from Bloomberg indicated that PIA's liabilities amount to Rs743 billion (approximately $2.5 billion), surpassing its total assets by five times.
As previously reported on October 14 by The Express Tribune, PIA requested an additional borrowing of over Rs7 billion from banks due to concerns about potential suspension of flight operations amidst a severe financial crisis. The airline has approached the Aviation Division for immediate loans, including a government-guaranteed option for securing Rs7.5 billion.

4,Govt slashes diesel price by Rs7,Keeps petrol rate unchanged; increases LPG price by 1.5%,"The government on Thursday slashed the price of high speed diesel (HSD) by Rs7 per litre in line with fluctuation in the global oil prices effective from Dec 1, 2023.
Diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. Therefore, reduction in its price will have direct inflationary impact for the consumers.
Following the reduction, high speed diesel (HSD) will be sold at Rs289.71 per litre against the earlier price of Rs296.71 per litre, registering a decline of Rs7 per litre.
However, the government decided to maintain the existing prices of petrol for the next fortnight during month of December.
Petrol is used by motorbikes and cars.
It is an alternate to CNG which would not be available for retail outlets.
The country faces gas shortages in the winter season. Therefore, gas may not be available for CNG retail outlets and therefore, the demand of petrol will rise.
Petrol will be sold at its existing price of Rs281.34 per litre.
In a statement, the finance ministry said that the federal government had decided to revise the prices of petroleum products following the recommendations of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
The government has decided to reduce the price of kerosene oil by Rs3.82 per litre.
Kerosene oil is used in remote areas like the northern part of the country for cooking purpose where Liqufied Petroleum Gas (LPG) was not available.

Following the reduction, kerosene oil will be available at Rs201.16 per litre against its earlier price of Rs204.98 per litre.
The price of light diesel oil (LDO) has also come down by Rs4.52 per litre from Rs180.45 to Rs175.93 per litre.
Meanwhile, Ogra has raised the consumer price of LPG by 1.5 per cent.
Following the federal government's policy guidelines, the regulator has set new prices for LPG effective from Dec 1, 2023.
The LPG price is now available at Rs213,560.49 per ton, which equates to Rs2,520.01 for an 11.8kg cylinder. This is an increase from Nov 2023, when the prices were Rs209,731.22 per ton and Rs2,474.83 per cylinder.
The LPG consumer price has also been adjusted. For Dec 2023, it is set at Rs254,860.49 per ton or Rs3,007.35 for each 11.8kg cylinder.
In Nov 2023, the consumer price was Rs251,031.22 per ton or Rs2,962.17 per cylinder. This marks an increase of Rs3,829.27 per ton and Rs45.18 per cylinder.
Ogra attributed the price changes to the fluctuation in the US dollar exchange rate, which went up by 1.87%.
However, the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP), which also influences LPG prices in Pakistan, remained unchanged.
As a result of these factors, the LPG consumer price saw an increase of 1.5%, or Rs45.18 per 11.8 kg cylinder, and the per kilo increase in LPG consumer price is Rs3.82.

Iqbal claimed that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was convicted in fabricated cases. He hoped that Nawaz would be exonerated in the Al-Azizia case too after his acquittal in the Avenfield reference. Speaking on the occasion, MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar, who was part of the delegation, explained that his party and the PML-N had joined hands in an attempt to develop a national consensus.
He added that his party had done its homework and came to the conclusion that only a strong local government system could ensure the progress of the country. MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal said the PPP, a former coalition partner of both the parties, did not have the excellence that any other party could not form its government in Sindh.
The PPP has been in power in Sindh for nearly 1.5 decades and the province is considered its stronghold. “We [MQM-P] are the second largest party in Sindh. Even the PML-N has had a chief minister in the province too,” he pointed out. He continued that the parties in the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) had also remained in power in Sindh as well.
Kamal’s remarks made it further clear that the alliance between the PML-N and MQM-P is aimed at dethroning the PPP in Sindh.
