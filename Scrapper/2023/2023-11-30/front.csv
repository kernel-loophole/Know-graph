0,Naqvi files second plea against SJC,Also asks three-member SC committee to list his petitions for hearing expeditiously,"While vehemently denying the various allegations leveled against him, Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi has once again requested the apex court to quash the misconduct proceedings initiated against him by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). In his second constitution petition filed on Thursday, Justice Naqvi has also requested the court to declare as “without legal authority” the SJC’s second and revised show cause notice issued on Nov 22.
Separately, the judge has also dispatched a letter to a three-member committee of the Supreme Court formed under the newly promulgated Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 to list his constitutional petitions and applications seeking interim relief expeditiously. The judge has reminded the committee that as per the SC act, it is entrusted with the responsibility of listing petitions filed under Article 184(3) within 14 days.
“However, in spite of these petitions and applications having been filed, the SJC is proceeding against me which is seriously prejudicing my constitutional petitions.” “If any order is passed [by the SJC] on the basis of the proceedings, it may frustrate my submissions, agitated in the constitution petitions,” he adds. The judge has requested the committee to list the case for hearing before a bench not including the SC judges that are part of the SJC.

Interestingly, all the three members of the committee—Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood and Justice Ijazul Ahsan—are part of the five-member SJC that is holding proceedings against Justice Naqvi. On October 21, the SJC with a majority vote of three to two issued a show cause notice to Justice Naqvi while reviewing complaints—ten in total—filed against the SC judge earlier this year. The council asked him to file his reply in 14 days.
On November 10, Justice Naqvi submitted his response to the show cause notice, accusing three SJC members – Justice Isa, Justice Masood, and Balochistan High Court (BHC) Chief Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan – of bias and requesting their recusal. Despite Justice Naqvi's objections, the SJC set a hearing for November 20 to review the complaints against him. At the end of the next SJC meeting that started on November 20 and continued till November 22, the SJC issued a revised second show cause notice to the judge.


On November 20, Justice Naqvi also lodged a constitution petition in the apex court, contesting the council’s proceedings. He requested the court to nullify the misconduct allegations against him, deeming them “without lawful authority and of no legal effect”. In the petition submitted on Thursday, November 30, the SC judge gave para-wise replies to ten allegations with regard to which the SJC had sought clarification from him on November 22.
While denying all the allegations with regard to listing of cases as well as those related to allegedly wrongful sale and purchase of properties as well as his family sons alleged role as his front men, Justice took serious exception to the use of the word ""corruption"" in the revised show cause notice. “It is improper and discourteous to use such language regarding a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. More than the petitioner, use of such language undermines the sanctity and integrity of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

“Use of such language is evidence of the [biases] and partiality of the members of SJC,” he stated. The petition stated that none of the so-called complaints disclose any case against the petitioner. “These cannot form the basis of a show cause notice. Had the SJC examined the co-called complaints, it would have [become] obvious that no case for issuing a show cause notice was made out.”
The judge noted that undue haste in conducting proceedings against him without first deciding his legal and constitutional objections and providing him the essential material establish that the SJC proceedings are unfair. “He is being denied a fair hearing in contravention of the fundamental rights guaranteed, inter alia, under Article 4, 9, 10A, 14 and 25 of the Constitution,” he stated.
The judge also referred to the ""malicious campaign"" lodged against him prior to filing of the complaints. He declared them a “direct and blatant attack on the independence of judiciary”. “These are violative of and inconsistent with the right to access justice guaranteed under Article 4, 9 and 10A of the Constitution,” he added.  The judge requested the court to suspend the SJC proceeding until it decides on his petitions.

1,PPP vows to spring ‘Jiyala’ surprise on Feb 8,"Bilawal, Zardari term Balochistan ‘heart of Pakistan’; promise ‘People’s Charter of Economy’","The top-most leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Thursday promised to spring ‘Jiyala’ surprise in the Feb 8 general elections, claiming that their rivals were nowhere near even understanding the problems facing the people.
The PPP held a major power show in the Balochistan capital to commemorate the party’s 56th foundation day, where party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Co-chairman Asif Zardari and the provincial leaders, including Sanaullah Zehri, Changaiz Jamali and others, delivered fiery speeches.
Addressing the flag-waving supporters at the jam-packed Ayub Stadium on the western outskirts of Quetta, both Bilawal and Zardari described Balochistan as the heart of Pakistan, saying that without it, the country could not progress.

“Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is going to be the youngest prime minister of Pakistan,” Zardari told the crowd, as the stadium resonated with slogans of “Wazeer-e-Azam Bilawal”, while music and party songs reverberated.
Zardari praised Bilawal for representing Pakistan “exceptionally well” during his tenure as the foreign minister in the previous coalition government. “It is time to make Bilawal the young leader of Pakistan, a leader guiding the nation.”
Reciprocating the sentiments of his father, Bilawal told the gathering that only the PPP was serious about the general elections. “With the support of the people, the Peoples Party will spring a huge surprise on Feb 8,” he said. “The next chief minister of Balochistan will also be a Jiyala.”

Bilawal stated that no politician could become a “counterforce” to the PPP. “The only opposition to the PPP is poverty, unemployment, and inflation.”
On a personal note, he said: “I am not a seasonal democrat; I will protect the Constitution, whether we are in the government or in the opposition.” Firing a broadside at the rivals, Bilawal called for an end to the politics of hate, as he accused both the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of failing to address the issues facing the country.
Bilawal underscored that it was time to think about politics that revolved around addressing the issues of the people, instead of fuelling hatred and division. “It is time to empower the people so that they can fight harsh economic conditions,” he continued.
“We do not want to target or criticise any specific politician. We stand for politics of tolerance,” he said. He vowed not to waste energies on political opponents, rather fight against poverty, unemployment, and the worst inflation in the country,” he said. The PPP would frame a “People’s Charter of Economy”.

Both Bilawal and Zardari boasted of various development projects initiated by the last PPP government from 2008 to 2013 for Balochistan, including the Aghaz-e-Haqooq Balochistan, the 18th Amendment to empower provinces and the National Finance Commission Award to enhance provincial share. The former president described Balochistan as the heart of Pakistan.
However, he added, this heart was not seen by Islamabad and the rulers. “Only Peoples Party can see this heart,” he said. “Issues of Pakistan can be fixed if the issue of its heart [Balochistan] is resolved.” He urged the masses to acknowledge the pain and sufferings prevailing in Balochistan and the need for a remedy.

“We have formulae to build Pakistan and strengthen Balochistan,” he said, adding that the PPP had always been committed to serving the people, workers, and farmers. “Everything in Balochistan belongs solely and exclusively to Balochistan, not to anyone else,” the former president declared.
“The land of Balochistan is distinct from the lands of other provinces,” he said. “The PPP has the formula to strengthen Balochistan.” Similar views about Balochistan were expressed by Bilawal in his fiery speech. “Balochistan is a land of brave and proud people with a long history of struggle against dictatorship and in defence of democracy,” he said.

Bilawal underscored that the PPP would fight for the youth and assist them with the scheme of ‘Youth Cards’.
He highlighted that the PPP would focus on vocational and skill training, while assisting the youth with finances for a whole year.
He also talked about the farmers, saying that farmers played the role of the backbone of the economy of Pakistan.
They would be provided with subsidies by introducing ‘Kissan cards’, emphasising that the prosperity of the farmers would contribute to the overall well-being of Pakistan.

2,PM to be booked if Baloch students not found: IHC,AGP tells judge 22 of them recovered but 28 still remain missing,"An Islamabad High Court judge on Wednesday expressed his extreme anger and frustration over the cases of enforced disappearance in the country and warned that if the missing people were not found, the court would order the registration of a first information reports (FIR) against the interim prime minister and interior minister.

IHC’s Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani was hearing the case about the disappearance of around 50 Baloch students.

In his hard-hitting observations, the judge noted that the cases were blamed on the state agencies, adding that it appeared that it had become a free-for-all society.

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan informed the court that 22 Baloch students had been found, but 28 were still missing.

The AGP added that efforts were under way for the recovery all the missing people.

Justice Kayani remarked that it was a matter of basic human rights but it seemed that there was no law and order in the country.

He added that everyone was resorting to whatever actions pleased them.

“Are these things done in a civilised society?” an irked judge inquired sarcastically.

Justice Kayani wondered why every recovered missing person did not wish to pursue their case.

He mentioned a statement of interim Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti, who was present in the court, and had claimed that there were many examples of people going to Afghanistan and some of them dying while fighting with the Pakistani security forces.

“I am explaining this in very clear words,” he told the interior minister. “If the missing persons are not recovered, I will order an FIR against the prime minister and interior minister. The defence and interior secretaries will also be held responsible,” he added.

“All the missing are university students. Aren't they Pakistani citizens? All the blame goes on the state agencies. There is no exception for any agency that it had taken away people for years. When these questions arise internationally, we have no answers,” he observed.

“Bring those who are terrorists to courts,” the judge remarked. “If we can hold [Indian spy] Kulbhushan Jadhav’s trial, we can hold anyone else's trial as well,” he continued.

Justice Kayani called for the resolution of the cases of enforced disappearances or bringing them to court.

The judge said that all the state agencies should have been asked about the missing person cases. He pointed out that the people affiliated with state institutions were blamed in such cases. He regretted that on the one hand, specific institutions were blamed, while on the other, there was no investigation.

The judge inquired why no action had been taken by holding any the state institution accountable.
He remarked that the defence secretary was responsible to ensure that agencies under him were not involved in any such activity.

“Our problem is that we don’t even believe that these are cases of enforced disappearance. The judges can’t go and recover these people. We can [only] deliver judgments,” he said.

“If anyone is involved in anti-state activities, take action according to the law, but bring him to a court,” he continued.

Justice Kayani acknowledged the sacrifices rendered by the state institutions for maintaining peace in the country.

“This country stands on the foundation laid by martyrs. There is no denying the sacrifices rendered by the [soldiers of the] Pakistan Army,” he noted, adding that there were other aspects that could not be ignored either.

The court directed that details of the families of all the missing persons should be provided to a government committee.

The judge directed the interim interior minister to meet with the families of the missing Baloch students in two weeks and even travel to Balochistan if they lived there.

Justice Kayani pointed out that all the high courts and the Supreme Court had ruled that it was the state’s responsibility to support the families of missing persons. He warned that the families of the missing persons could claim damages from the high officials of the state institutions and hold them as the accused.

The judge ordered that if the missing students were not recovered till the next date of hearing, he would order the lodging of an FIR against the caretaker prime minister, the interior minister as well as the defence and interior secretaries.

Later, the court adjourned the hearing until January 10.

Talking to media persons after the attending the hearing, interim Interior Minister Bugti said the caretaker government would try its best to resolve the issue of missing persons.

“As the matter is sub judice, it should not be discussed publicly,” he added.

The interim minister said the caretaker Balochistan chief minister had formed an inquiry commission to probe into the murder allegations against the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).

“If the allegation proved correct, action will be taken according to the law,” he continued.
Responding to a query, Bugti explained that there was a very thin line between self-disappearance, enforced disappearance and missing.

He insisted that there were many cases of self-disappearances, but those related to enforced disappearances were yet to be decided under the UN Charter.

“The commission would categorise the cases of self-disappearances, enforced disappearances and the missing persons after reviewing all [of them],” he said, adding that on the court’s directions, he would invite the families of the missing Baloch students and listen to their grievances.

3,A shot in the arm for ex-PM,Senior lawyers feel Panama jurisprudence significantly tarnished reputation of certain judges,"The acquittal of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif in the Avenfield case has not only come as a shot in the arm for the former premier but has also cast a shadow of embarrassment over the Supreme Court, which had monitored the trial and investigation during the tenure of ex-CJP Mian Saqib Nisar.

Senior legal experts are calling for introspection within the judiciary, urging a shift away from perceptions of political bias or manipulation against any specific party or leader, and asking the superior courts to learn from “mistakes”.

Meanwhile, observers are keen to assess whether Nawaz Sharif's exoneration will have implications for ongoing cases involving Imran Khan, his successor and main rival. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is set to review a petition on Thursday (today) seeking Imran’s acquittal in the Toshakhana case.

The written order, authored by ex-judge Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan in the Panama case, had urged the chief justice of Pakistan to nominate a judge to oversee the judgment's implementation and monitor NAB proceedings.

Notably, in the Panama case, ex-premier Imran Khan was the petitioner against the Sharif family members.

""The Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan is requested to nominate an Hon’ble Judge of this Court to supervise and monitor implementation of this judgment in letter and spirit and oversee the proceedings conducted by NAB and the Accountability Court,” the court order read.

Following the directive, former CJP Saqib Nisar designated Justice Ijazul Ahsan, a member of the larger bench, as the monitoring judge. Nonetheless, the order was silent over the delineation of the supervision's parameters.

In a review petition, Sharif’s counsel, Khawaja Haris, had argued that the oversight would compromise a fair trial, given the SC had itself become the complainant, prosecutor, as well as judge.

The apex court while rejecting Nawaz Sharif's review petition against the Panama verdict said that the argument that the power to superintend the proceedings of the accountability court has not been conferred on the  SC.

Therefore, it noted, the nomination of one of the judges of SC to superintend them would be violative of Article 175(2) and (3) of the  Constitution is also misconceived “as this practice has been in vogue since long and the purpose behind it is to guard against the intrusion of casualness in the proceedings before the trial court”.

""Such practice, by no stretch of imagination, implies that the monitoring Judge would in any way influence or interfere with the decision-making process of the Trial Court. It is completely innocuous to either of the parties would not tend to harm any"", said the judgement issued on September 15, 2017.”

In November 2017, the Islamabad Accountability Court-I judge denied Nawaz’s application to club all three references against him for a joint trial. But in June next year, the SC allowed the accountability court an unrealistic four-week extension when it sought permission for the move.

The extension ended just two weeks before the general election in 2018 and when the judgment came out, Nawaz, his daughter Maryam and her husband Captain Safdar were convicted and put behind bars just before the polls.

At the time when these references were filed against the Sharif family at the direction of the apex court, Qamar Zaman Chaudhry held the position of NAB chairman.

After the general elections in 2018, a division bench of IHC led by Justice Athar Minallah suspended the Avenfield reference judgment and granted bail to Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz and Captain Safdar. However, SC judges and the establishment were upset about the high court's observations against the trial court order.

It is learnt that a former chief justice desired for the Islamabad High Court to swiftly address the appeals of the Sharif family, leading to the matter reaching the Supreme Court for ultimate resolution during his tenure.

However, the Islamabad High Court delayed the disposition of these appeals. Presently, except one, all judges from the Panama bench have retired.

Similarly, the judges who are in the driving seat in SC have already voiced serious concerns regarding the Panama judgment. Moreover, the dynamics of ‘powerful circles’ have undergone a shift, now seemingly adopting a role as facilitators for Nawaz Sharif.

Senior lawyers hold the view that the Panama jurisprudence significantly tarnished the reputation of certain judges who were previously highly regarded in society.

Moreover, there are serious allegations suggesting that intelligence agencies manipulated judicial proceedings against the Sharif family during the Panama trial. Former IHC judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had made grave accusations concerning the manipulation of judicial proceedings in the matter.
