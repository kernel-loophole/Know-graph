1,Baqar orders bridge on Phuleli Canal,Directs administration to take action against fertiliser hoarders,"The Caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar has approved the construction of a bridge on Phuleli Canal at the cost of Rs250 million, acknowledging the bridge's need during his visit on Wednesday. The approval was given at meeting held at Government College University, Hyderabad.
The bridge will connect Abdul Sattar Edhi Road on the right bank of the canal to the Government College University on the left bank. The CM ordered the officials to complete all the formalities leading to the approval of the project's PC-I within 15 days. On the second day of his two-day visit to Hyderabad, the CM also visited Liaquat University Hospital, Hatri police station, Qasimabad taluka and Latifabad taluka. 
At the meeting, the CM was also briefed about the encroachment and dumping of the solid, municipal and hazardous waste in the Phuleli Canal, which is the largest of the three canals springing from left bank of the Kotri Barrage.
The encroachment has also shrunken the canal's width, also causing a drop in its water taking capacity in addition to weaker embankments which witness overtopping during flood season and torrential rains. Moreover, approximately 200 cusecs of wastewater is released in the canal on a daily basis, causing illness among the people drinking from the canal in parts of Hyderabad and Tando Muhammad Khan districts.
Civil Hospital
While visiting the LUH's old building, the CM witnessed the official neglect which has left the structure in a crumbly condition, with the ceiling plasters showing ruptures and the walls reflecting seepage. Upon inquiry, the chief engineer Buildings department told Baqar that repair and maintenance budget for the hospital of Rs140 million is insufficient to undertake preservation of the pre-partition structure. The CM ordered the release of the required budget for the needed works.
He also checked all the operation theatres and expressed displeasure with the administration over the unhygienic conditions. All the surgeries scheduled for Wednesday were cancelled apparently due to the CM's visit, drawing his ire on the medical superintendent Dr Shahid Junejo.At the hospital's pharmacy no proper record of the medicines purchase was maintained by the concerned officials, prompting the CM to order an inquiry.

He found the toilets filthy. He later reprimanded the district health officer for not inspecting the LUH regularly to identify the shortcomings and problems and to seek resolution of the same. He was briefed that the hospital has a budget of Rs6 billion and that 12,000 to 15,000 patients visit that tertiary healthcare facility every day. He was told that the pathology department conducted around 7,000 lab tests daily.
Hoarding of fertilizers
Meeting a delegation of the farmers' representatives, the CM directed all the deputy commissioners in the province to launch a crackdown against the hoarders of urea and fertilizer. Baqar also asked them to maintain the record of the fertilizer bags which are supplied and sold in a particular district. The issue of separation of Left Bank Outfall Drain from Dhoro Puran, another saline water drain, was also discussed.
While visiting Latifabad, Baqar came across the people who complained against WASA and other civic agencies for poor water supply, drainage and solid waste disposal. The people also complained about poor road conditions in the city.
The CM asked the IG Sindh police to instantly release funds for renovation of Hatri police station whose rickety structure posed threats to the cop and the visitors. The CM also witnessed that the case property vehicles are parked under sun and are exposed to inclement weather. He issued directions for arranging proper parking for such vehicles.

4,‘Officials involved in case cannot investigate it’,Defence demands inquiry by police officers from other district,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has sought an explanation from the DIG West and other police officers over the investigation of under training DSP Umair Tariq Bajari in the matter of alleged police robbery within the Pirabad police station boundaries.
Advocate Aamir argued in the High Court that West Police are directly involved in the matter, and the same officers are also investigating the issue. ""How can the officials involved in the case investigate it?,"" he said 
SSP West had received information about the raid from the former SSP South. SHO Pirabad handed over the case property to SHO Defence. Although it was against the law, they should nevertheless have registered the case and money should have been deposited in the case property to strengthen the case. Why is the case being investigated by those who hid the relevant facts? These people were all already well-informed.
The court has been urged that this case should be investigated by reputed police officers of another district.
The court postponed the hearing to December 4 while ordering to submit written responses from each of the concerned officers.

5,Local govts should be in place before elections: Kamal,MQM-P’s Senior Deputy Convenor inaugurates party's central election office in Shah Faisal,"Senior Deputy Convenor of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) Mustafa Kamal has said that the decision to hold the general elections should be reconsidered until local government committees are established.
Kamal said that at the inauguration of the MQM-P's central election office in UC-7 of Shah Faisal Town where Coordination Committee members, including Muhammad Abu Bakr, Afaq Jamal, Farqan Ateeb, Asia Ishaq, and Masood Mahmood, were also present. 
Kamal said that the Election Commission of Pakistan has announced the date of the general election which would be held on February 8. ""As political parties campaign to gather support, voters often remain uninformed about their post-election plans,"" he said. 
While referring to the myriad of challenges faced by Karachi for the past 75 years, Kamal said that the situation would have been starkly different if the political parties had prioritized well-being of this city's residents. 
The PPP ruled Sindh for 15 years and spent Rs22,000 billion, but Karachi is ranked the fourth worst city in the world in terms of livability. ""In contrast, the MQM-P's investment of Rs300 billion has contributed to making Karachi one of the 12 fastest-growing cities globally,"" he claimed.
""We are not here only today; we stand by you every day. Hold us accountable if we renege on our promises. The remarkable growth of our city is a testament to our commitment to serving people of all ages, despite past mistakes,"" Kamal asserted.

He argued that during the recent census conducted by the PPP, Karachi's population count was inaccurately lowered compared to the previous one. Kamal stated that MQM-P has conducted its own census, and when all three National Assembly and provincial assembly seats from interior Sindh are considered, Karachi will surpass rural Sindh significantly.
Highlighting demographic statistics, Kamal mentioned that Karachi holds 50% of Sindh's population, while Hyderabad has 8%. Including other urban centres, the population of urban Sindh reaches 65%. He suggested that with these numbers, the chief minister of Sindh should be from Karachi. 
The MQM-P has drafted constitutional amendments aiming to empower local governments nationwide, ensuring they receive their rights directly from the federation, Kamal said.

6,Citywide theft of road items disrupts public order,Survey reveals police negligence is to blame,"While most would consider stealing private possessions as being a common form of theft, the recent disappearance of public property in the commercial hub, raises a new law and order situation.
With drug abuse and unemployment on the rise, many addicts and jobless people have started stealing covers of sewage manholes, grills of pedestrian bridges, railings of footpaths, cables of traffic signals and equipment for developmental projects, in broad daylight and at night, in order to extract iron from the stolen items and sell it for money.
As a road eyewitness Muhammad Ahmed revealed, “I have personally seen many thieves stealing wood from the green belts and footpaths of various roads, several times a day.” Ahmed, further added that he had even caught a thief red-handed once, and had tried recording a video but was unsuccessful, as the criminal had already escaped.
According to Water Board District East Executive’s Engineer, Waqar Ahmad, the incidents of stealing various road items, including manhole covers, have increased significantly in the past few years. Indeed, missing manholes can be located all across the city, in areas including Gulshan Iqbal, Landhi, Korangi, Malir, Shah Faisal Colony, Lyari, Pir Colony, Orangi Town, Federal B Area, Federal Capital Area, Garden, Ranchore Lines, and Kharadar, among many others. 
Despite the wide prevalence of the crime, survey results show a decrease in the number of regular police mobile patrols in the city, ultimately implying that even though the vice is rampantly disrupting public order, the concerned law enforcement authorities are showing complicity.
As a survey carried out by the Express Tribune confirmed, “Even when people report missing manhole covers and traffic cables to the police, they rarely take the issue seriously.” In his response to the allegations Waqar Ahmad shared, “Since the number of manhole handle thefts have increased drastically in the past few years, it has become increasingly difficult for the police to respond to every single complain that they receive.”

Read CM goes hard on police for alarming rise in street crimes
According to officials of the District Municipal Corporation, the maintenance of water and sewage system, including the replacement and supervision of manhole handles, is the responsibility of Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), but the board has failed miserably at fulfilling its duties, since leakage in water lines, overflow of sewage manholes and unavailability of manhole covers are common complaints.
Missing manholes handles, however is not the only issue bedeviling public order since many reports claim that most of the pedestrian bridges installed in the city have their steel rods stolen by drug addicts, who take refuge in nooks and corners around the bridge. This results in a hazardous situation for regular pedestrians, who cross the bridge, in fear of succumbing to their injuries following an unanticipated fall.
Moreover, according to Xen Raza Hussain of the Traffic Engineering Bureau, “Many drug addicts also steel traffic signal cables, which causes the traffic lights to malfunction, leading to a traffic blockage.”
Many developmental projects, including the Orange and Red Lines, have also been adversely affected by the rise in cases of road theft.  According to sources, drug addicts would steal the cables surrounding the Orange Line and the traffic and safety signboards placed around the Red Line.  
Speaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, Xen Raza Hussain added, “While I agree that no First Information Reports (FIR)’s were registered against cases of road theft earlier, we are now actively filing FIR’s against the perpetrators, whether they be drug addicts or rickshaw drivers.”
