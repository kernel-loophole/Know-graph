1,1,Governing the food systems,"Along with change in dietary patterns and lifestyles, our community disease profile is also changing","Food systems are changing, and changing at an enormous speed. Along with the change in dietary patterns and lifestyles, our community disease profile is also changing. Instead of the infectious diseases like cholera and TB, now the non-communicable ailments (NCDs) such cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, hypertension, cancers, mental disorders and obesity are the main reasons behind unhealthy life, disabilities and death. Why is food or dietary pattern important in disease burden? The answer is simple: human beings are also chemical beings. What they eat interacts with of their body and mind in various complex ways. With this simple sensibility comes a great understanding that oil and fats, added sugars (e.g. sugary drinks) and salt are dietary risk factors in the increasing incidence and prevalence of NCDs. 
In Pakistan, NCDs now cause more than 60% of deaths, and around 30% are attributed to CVDs and these deaths are higher than global average. Pakistan hosts the third largest population of people with diabetes in the world i.e. 33 million whereas 10 million more are pre-diabetic. Hypertension is also taking its toll with 43% of adults ageing 30-79 are carrying the disease, and, most importantly, not everyone is being treated with high-quality standard treatment regime for these diseases.
All this tells us a sad story of lives being lost prematurely i.e. before the age of 70; family financial losses due to inability to work and spending hard-earned money on treatments of avoidable diseases; and deaths at the time when one is thought to be the most productive, thereby stunting our GDP. This story calls for action — not only for some sort of awareness, but also for policy and administrative measures to build and strengthen a health security regime in the country. 
While there is no one silver bullet to solve the problems of CVDs, high blood pressure, high blood glucose and high body mass index, there are certain policy measures and best policy practices which can be applied to control dietary risk factors for a majority of population. First and foremost, we propose and advocate for looking seriously into the prevalent state of affairs in food systems and its governance. One of the most important aspects is to ensure that food supply is safe to consume and is nutritious. 
Looking at the supply of fats and vanaspati ghee, Pakistan encounters serious problems to deal with. In Pakistan, most of the street food and vanaspati ghee is replete with iTFAs (industrially produced trans fatty acids) which many medical researches have declared associated with NCDs. WHO recommends that there should be no more than 2% of iTFAs in any fat used in any food item. Pakistan is many moons away from implementing this best practice policy which has helped reduce CVDs in many countries such as Denmark. Countries like Saudi Arabia have even banned the production of vanaspati ghee to completely eradicate the menace from food supplies. Our foods, specially the highly processed, fast and frozen foods, have high quantities of added sugars and sodium, and our society is falling prey to these risky food supplies. Over and above, such foods are sold without proper front of product labelling (FOPL) and warning signs. 
So, in addition to the need of having good quality accessible and affordable healthcare to everyone, there is a need to provide safe to consume food so that our health system does not break down due to the ever-increasing pressure of unwell and unhealthy population. 
Last but not least, we propose and argue for modernising the system of food related governance. We need to build technical, human, infrastructure and legal-administrative capacity of various institutions such as Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority, PCSIR and Provincial Food Authorities, and look at the “new foods” part of public health concerns. It is hoped that by controlling dietary risk factors, Pakistan ensures a better health security regime for its citizens.

2,2,Karachi’s industrialists pin hopes for revival on 2024,"Call for clear industrial policy, prioritising domestic investment over foreign investment","Leading industrialists in Sindh have labelled 2023 as lacklustre and troublesome, plagued by energy crises, economic meltdown, strikes, and a lack of government support. Despite these challenges, they maintain an optimistic approach in 2024 and hope for the best.
“2023 was tumultuous, with industrialists facing numerous challenges, including skyrocketing gas and electricity tariffs, almost doubling, causing a severe economic slowdown, impacting cash flow, and rendering the industry uncompetitive compared to regional countries. It was an uphill battle,” remarked Muhammad Kamran Arbi, President of the Site Association of Industry (SAI).
He highlighted that after multiple assurances from caretaker setups, industrialists are hopeful for a better 2024. Arbi also called for a clear and consistent industrial policy, endorsing the Charter of Economy presented by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) to promote industry and exports.
As Karachi enters 2024, the city’s industrial landscape continues to grapple with challenges from the preceding year, noted Siraj S Monnoo, President of the Landhi Association of Trade and Industry. He added that 2023 painted a sombre picture of economic hardships, prompting a call for strategic interventions.
Throughout 2023, Karachi’s industries faced a complex set of challenges, ranging from soaring utility tariffs to issues of gas availability, water shortages, corruption, political instability, inflation, and inadequate infrastructure, he said. This amalgamation of difficulties posed a significant threat to the sustainability of businesses in the region.
Acknowledging the indispensable role of supporting industries in Karachi’s economic fabric, Monnoo stressed the need for a comprehensive strategy to address multifaceted challenges. He highlighted that this strategy should encompass effective governance, impactful policy reforms, and targeted investments to foster holistic economic improvement.
Looking ahead to 2024, he said as Karachi enters this year, business leaders are poised to apply lessons learned from the challenges of the past year. The emphasis on effective governance, policy reforms, and strategic investments remains paramount.

“The challenges of 2023 serve as a catalyst for holistic development strategies in 2024. Business leaders like me are expected to actively participate in shaping policies, engaging in collaborative initiatives, and driving investments that contribute to the comprehensive economic improvement of Karachi,” he said.
Despite the significant challenges of the past year, Karachi’s industrial sector remains steadfast in its pursuit of a brighter economic future, he said, adding that collaborative efforts set the stage for a resilient and dynamic business environment in 2024, underscoring the collective responsibility to overcome obstacles and build a prosperous future for the city.
President of the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI), Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani stated that 2023 was a tumultuous year for the country, largely attributed to the significant surge in electricity and gas tariffs following stringent directives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He pointed out that in comparison with India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam, Pakistan faces nearly double the electricity and gas costs, presenting a challenging barrier for the country’s industries to enhance production and bolster exports.
Shaikhani stressed that solely relying on foreign investments, while sidelining domestic investment, would not foster economic stability, as foreign investors tend to follow local investors. Countries that do not provide adequate facilities to local investors seldom attract foreign investment. Nurturing and supporting domestic investors is pivotal to attract foreign investment and stabilise the economy. 
To address these challenges, he advocated prioritising the continuity of economic policies to spur fresh investments. Emphasising the significance of thorough examination and consultation with stakeholders, a comprehensive, long-term investment policy must be crafted.

3,3,Profit-taking pulls stock market down,"KSE-100 index dips 250.73 points, settles at 63,919.85","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) extended its losing streak on Wednesday as it witnessed a mixed trading session that succumbed to profit-taking, ending the day slightly below the 64,000 mark with a loss of 250 points.
In the morning, trading started on a negative note but after taking a dip, the market quickly gained ground, led by buying interest in Pakistan Petroleum and Oil and Gas Development Company.
The momentum continued well after midday, resultantly, the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day high at 64,550.94 points.
However, investor sentiment received a blow in the absence of major positive triggers coupled with the prevailing political uncertainty. The market succumbed to late-session profit-booking in banking and fertiliser sectors and ended the session below the 64,000 mark.
“Stocks closed bearish due to late-session selling amid pre-poll uncertainty and foreign fund outflows,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Mid-session support came on the back of upbeat data of home remittances that surged 13% year-on-year (YoY), or $282 million, and increase in global crude oil prices,” he said.
“Political uncertainty and worries about the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) policy rate announcement this month amid surging inflation played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 250.73 points, or 0.39%, and settled at 63,919.85.
Topline Securities, in its report, noted that it was “another day of consolidation”.
Pakistan equities moved in both directions. Initially, the KSE-100 index hit the intra-day high at 64,551 (+380 points, or 0.59%), it said, adding that profit-taking forced the index to lose the earlier ground. Owing to investor selling, the PSX could not hold the 64,000 level.
Investors took profit in selective stocks of banking and fertiliser sectors in the backdrop of increasing noise on the political front and the absence of positive triggers. It marked the fifth consecutive negative session at the PSX.
Read Despite fall, PSX stays above 64,000 mark
Resultantly, Meezan Bank, Engro Corporation, Bank AL Habib, Engro Fertilisers and United Bank cumulatively lost 182 points, Topline said.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, stated that “breaking down from 64,000 sets up a test of key near-term support at 63,000 before resuming higher towards 67,000”.
“Seasonal factors favour a rising market into February, which should coincide with a new high,” it said, adding that with two sessions to go this week, price action remained inside last week’s range.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said that it was the third consecutive day of losses at the PSX this week.
“Investors are advised to adopt a cautious stance and accumulate value stocks on dips,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 636.2 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 448.99 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs17.98 billion.
Shares of 361 companies were traded. Of these, 155 stocks closed higher, 183 dropped and 23 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 151.2 million shares, losing Rs0.03 to close at Rs5.72. It was followed by Hascol Petroleum with 67.98 million shares, gaining Rs0.53 to close at Rs8.53 and WorldCall Telecom with 42.1 million shares, remaining unchanged at Rs1.43.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs82.6 million, according to the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited.

4,4,Pakistani textile innovation shines at Heimtextil 2024,Eco-friendly fabric made from maize waste captures global attention,"A Pakistani textile firm’s collaboration with a Danish material science company has resulted in the production of eco-friendly yarn and fabric from maize waste. The prototype was initially unveiled at the Heimtextil exhibition, a global textile fair. Towel products catering to newborns, infants, and individuals with skin sensitivities will be crafted from these sustainable materials. Following a successful trial, commercial production of yarn from corn and sugarcane waste is slated to commence in Pakistan.
At Heimtextil 2024, the world’s largest home textile industry exhibition, the fabric created from bio-engineered yarn by Pakistani textile firm Feroze 1888 Mills Limited, in partnership with Danish material science company Pond, stole the spotlight. Bioengineering textile fabric is a burgeoning trend globally, with a focus on creating sustainable products for the environment, businesses, and consumers. The demand for fabric made from natural ingredients, particularly organic and agricultural products, coupled with recycling, is rapidly increasing.
To maintain its standing in the global market, the Pakistani textile industry must diversify into new materials beyond traditional options like cotton and polyester. The production of yarn and fabric from corn and sugarcane waste by a Pakistani firm indicates a proactive approach by major players in Pakistan’s industry, showcasing an awareness and embrace of global market trends that surpass competitors.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Martin Jensen, Chief Technical Officer and Co-Founder of Pond, elucidated the collaboration at the Heimtextil exhibition. He said Pond’s focus on producing bio-engineered yarn from natural ingredients and agricultural waste like grasses, coffee plants, sugarcane husks, and corn husks. Jensen highlighted the global recognition received by big brands utilizing Pond’s fabric in clothing and joggers.

Jensen noted the keen interest shown by Feroze 1888 Mills Limited in Pond’s technology, leading to the production of a special fabric in Karachi under a joint project. This fabric, derived from corn husks, stands out for its softness, suppleness, and skin-friendly qualities, coupled with a significantly low electrical charge compared to polyester fabric.
Attributing the preference for Pakistani firms over those in India and Bangladesh to Pakistan’s prominent position in the home textile industry, he expressed satisfaction with the positive reception of the new fabric at Heimtextil. He anticipates further collaboration phases, including the production of bio-engineered yarn in Pakistan and partnerships with additional Pakistani firms.
Deputy General Manager of Planning, Development, and Innovation at Feroze 1888 Mills Ltd., Aamir Shabbir Ansari underscored the company’s commitment to environmentally friendly practices. The collaboration with Pond aligns with the company’s sustainability goals. Ansari shared that the fabric from corn waste, produced in collaboration with Pond at the Karachi facility, marks a significant contribution to Pakistan’s positive global image.
As a pilot project, the fabric has been developed from corn waste, blended with 50% cotton. Following the successful trial, commercial production is planned under favourable business conditions, with a flexible blend of 10% to 50% bioengineered yarn based on product and customer demand.

5,5,Remittances surge by 13% to $2.38b in Dec 2023,"Stability in rupee-dollar parity, crackdown on illegal networks boost numbers","The inflows of workers’ remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis increased by 13% to $2.38 billion in December 2023, as they dispatched the funds through official channels following the return of stability in the rupee-dollar parity and the crackdown against illegal currency networks.
The improvement in remittances fuelled the ongoing gradual rally in the rupee against the US dollar on Wednesday, strengthening the market view that the balance of the current account would record a surplus for the second consecutive month of December 2023.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that remittances rose by 13% compared to $2.10 billion in the same month of December of the previous year.
Inflows improved by 5.5% in the month compared to $2.26 billion in the prior month of November 2023.
However, workers’ remittances have cumulatively slowed down by 7% in the first half (Jul-Dec) of the current fiscal year 2023-24, amounting to $13.45 billion compared to $14.42 billion in the same period of the previous year, according to the central bank.
Topline Securities, CEO, Muhammad Sohail mentioned that the latest monthly inflows of $2.38 billion are higher than the full-year 2023 average of $2.20 billion a month.
Market talk suggests that the receipts have increased due to the crackdown against foreign currency smugglers, such as hawala-hundi operators and hoarders, since September 2023.
The cleanup operation crushed illicit currency markets, especially in the bordering areas with Afghanistan, and strengthened the hold of official operating networks like commercial banks and authorised exchange companies.
The crackdown not only helped arrest the then freefall in the domestic currency but also assisted it in bouncing back by over 9%, or around Rs26 in the past four months, closing at a 10-week high at Rs281.13 against the US dollar on Wednesday. Earlier, it had hit an all-time low at Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
The inflows of workers’ remittances play a pivotal role in the economy, significantly helping finance the twin trade and current account deficits.
The total inflows in the first half of FY24 have, however, slipped by 7% due to high volatility in the currency between July-September 2023, in the wake of the then political and economic instability, according to market talks.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Maaz Azam, Research Analyst at Optimus Capital Management, projected that the inflows would remain better in the second half of the ongoing fiscal year amid stability in the rupee-dollar exchange rate.
He estimated the average inflows at $2.4 billion a month during January-June 2024, including likely spikes above the average in the months around Ramadan and Eid festivals falling in the second half of FY24.
Read Remittances increase to $2.38 billion in December 2023
He foresaw FY24 full-year workers’ remittances inflows at $28.6 billion, slightly higher compared to the receipts at $27.3 billion recorded in FY23.
He noted that risk factors, which if occur, would disrupt the improved inflows, including the return of political and economic instability after the new political government is formed post the February 2024 general elections and a delay in the acquisition of another IMF programme after the current one of $3 billion completes in March 2024.
“The political instability and delays in the IMF new programme, if they take place, may allow illicit players to re-establish illegal currency markets and mount pressure on the rupee.”
On the flip side, a better-than-estimated increase in economic activities would prompt non-resident Pakistanis to send higher remittances, including for investment purposes. “The inflows would surge along with economic activities.”
He believed that overseas Pakistanis slowed down the dispatch of remittances for investment purposes amid the economic slowdown in the first half of FY24.
Region-wise inflows:
The central bank reported that remittance inflows during December 2023 were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia at $578 million, increasing by 9% from $530 million received in the same month of the previous year.
Non-resident Pakistanis dispatched $419 million from the United Arab Emirates in the month, which was 27% higher compared to $331 million in the same month of the previous year.
Expatriates sent 15% higher remittances at $368 million from the United Kingdom compared to $321 million.
They dispatched 9% higher remittances at $264 million from the United States of America compared to $243 million.
Inflows from other GCC countries improved 6% to $255 million in the month compared to $240 million.
Pakistanis from European Union countries sent $285 million remittances, which were 19% higher compared to $240 million.
Workers’ remittances surged by 9% to $213 million from other countries around the world in December 2023 compared to $195 million in December 2022.

6,6,Rupee surges on remittance boost,"Sixth day of gains fuelled by positive IMF outlook, increased inflows","In line with market expectations, the increase in inflows of workers’ remittances supported the rupee, hitting over a 10-week high at above Rs281 against the US dollar in the interbank market, maintaining a winning streak for the sixth successive working day on Wednesday.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency appreciated by 0.03%, or Rs0.09, to close at Rs281.13 against the greenback. It has cumulatively increased by 1.60% or Rs4.51 in the past six weeks to date, as the supply of foreign currency surpassed the demand in the market.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the currency improved by 0.56%, or Rs0.16, to close at Rs282.18/$ in the open market on a day-to-day basis. The central bank reported on Wednesday morning that the inflows of workers’ remittances have boosted by 13% to $2.38 billion in December 2023 compared to the same month last year. This supported the rupee to maintain the uptrend.
Read Rupee rises to two and a half month high at Rs281.26/$
Moreover, the optimism that the IMF executive board will approve the release of the next tranche of $700 million on Thursday (today) also supported the rupee.
The expected inflows, along with the receipts of $1.3 billion from multilateral creditors over the past two weeks, maintained the supply of foreign currency higher than its demand.
The development also prompted exporters to advance selling US dollars on the futures counter, as dealers believe the currency would soon hit Rs280/$ on the upside. Market talks suggest that the downturn in the international petroleum crude oil price was another significant reason for the gradual rally in the currency. Pakistan heavily relies on imported energies to meet local demand.

7,7,Cyber incidents hit 15% of global firms,Study cites dearth of investment in bolstering cybersecurity system,"An international cybersecurity and digital privacy company has reported that 15% of companies globally have experienced cyber incidents due to insufficient cybersecurity investment.
It is alarming that critical infrastructure, oil and gas and energy organisations have suffered the biggest number of cyber incidents.
According to a recent study conducted by Kaspersky, 15% of companies across the world encountered cyber incidents owing to the dearth of investment in that critical area over the last two years.
When it came to companies’ finances, one in five admitted they did not have the budget for adequate cybersecurity measures.
Kaspersky undertook the study to discover opinions of IT security professionals working for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other companies worldwide regarding the human impact on cybersecurity in a company. The telecommunications sector suffered 13% of cyber incidents due to budget constraints, while transport and logistics, and financial services’ companies each saw 8% of incidents.
When asked about the budget for cybersecurity measures, 78% of respondents said they were equipped to keep up with or even stay ahead of new threats.
However, 21% of companies were not doing so well while 18% reported that they didn’t have sufficient funds to protect the company’s infrastructure properly.

At the same time, there were companies having no cost allocations at all for cybersecurity. As many as 3% claimed they didn’t have a dedicated budget for cyber protection needs.
According to the report, many companies were eager to take steps to strengthen their cybersecurity system over the next up to one and a half year.
One of the most popular areas of investment is threat detection software and training where 39% of companies plan to allocate budget for educational programmes for cybersecurity professionals and 38% for training general staff.
Other popular measures organisations plan to take soon are introducing endpoint protection software, hiring additional IT professionals, and adopting SaaS cloud solutions. “Today, companies must align cybersecurity investment with business strategy and consider cybersecurity as one of their business goals,” commented Ivan Vassunov, VP Corporate Products at Kaspersky, adding that challenges could be met through the use of various modern approaches and technologies.

9,9,Croatia seeks better trade relationship,"Appoints honorary consul general in Karachi to enhance trade, streamline visa issuances","The Ambassador of the Republic of Croatia, Dr Drago Stambuk, acknowledged that although Croatia and Pakistan maintain friendly relations, the trade exchange between them is ‘not strong enough to be proud of.’ The Croatian Embassy is actively working to enhance this trade relationship, stated Stambuk during a meeting at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI).
Stambuk highlighted his duty to bring together business representatives from both sides. He expressed plans to organise political and economic consultations between the two countries to improve bilateral trade. He also highlighted the appointment of Mirza Imran Baig as the Honorary Consul General of Croatia in Karachi, considering it an extension of the Croatian Embassy’s outreach.
Identifying visa delays as a significant impediment to trade, the ambassador assured that efforts were underway to address this issue.

Stambuk underscored Croatia’s favourable geopolitical position within the Eurozone, featuring extensive ports and railway networks. Plans are in progress to position Croatia as the hub for Central and South-Eastern Europe. However, he noted demographic challenges in Croatia, expressing the need for skilled and young individuals. Recognising Pakistan’s valuable human resources, he encouraged more Pakistanis to explore opportunities in Croatia, particularly in the tourism industry.
KCCI President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh proposed that the Croatian Honorary Consul General in Karachi should be authorised to issue visas for Pakistani businesses based on KCCI’s recommendations.
